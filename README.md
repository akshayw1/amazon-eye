# Amazon Hackathon: Advanced Trust & Fraud Detection System

## üèÜ Project Overview

This project was developed for the Amazon India Hackathon with the theme "Advanced Trust Increase by Fraud Detection". The system implements a comprehensive multi-modal approach to detect fraudulent activities, counterfeit products, and maintain product lifecycle integrity on e-commerce platforms.

## üéØ Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms face multiple trust challenges:
- **Review Fraud**: Fake reviews manipulating product ratings
- **AI-Generated Content**: Automated spam reviews
- **Counterfeit Products**: Misleading product images and descriptions
- **Deceptive Listings**: Mismatched product images and descriptions
- **Product Identity Fraud**: Subtle visual manipulations

## üöÄ Solution Architecture

Our system employs 6 distinct AI-powered features working in tandem to create a robust trust framework:

### üîπ Feature 1: Fake Product Detection via Review Behavior & Network Patterns

**Objective**: Detect products involved in fake review campaigns using graph-based network analysis.

**Methodology**:
- Engineered review-based features (avg rating, review gaps, 1-star/5-star ratio, helpful votes)
- Constructed bipartite reviewer-product graphs and projected to product-product similarity networks
- Calculated network centrality measures: PageRank, eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient
- Trained RandomForestClassifier on 3,400 labeled Amazon products
- Applied K-Means clustering (k=20) on 64K unlabeled UCSD products for fraud-prone segment identification

**Key Innovation**: Detects review fraud without relying on textual or visual content analysis.

**Files**:
- `src/NetworkFeatures/feature_extraction.py` - Bipartite graph construction and metrics
- `src/NetworkFeatures/clustering_pipeline.py` - Clustering and prediction pipeline
- `src/NetworkFeatures/classifiers.py` - RandomForest training and evaluation
- `src/NetworkFeatures/run_pipeline.py` - Complete pipeline execution

### üîπ Feature 2: AI-Written Review Detection using RoBERTa

**Objective**: Identify AI-generated reviews to combat automated spam and fabricated feedback.

**Methodology**:
- Fine-tuned `roberta-base` model using HuggingFace Trainer
- Binary classification: AI-generated (1) vs Human-written (0)
- Deployed as REST API for real-time inference

**Impact**: Provides new trust signal based on AI-generated content percentage.

**Files**:
- `src/ReviewFeatures/train.py` - RoBERTa fine-tuning pipeline
- `src/ReviewFeatures/app.py` - Flask API endpoint `/check_ai_review`

### üîπ Feature 3: Image-Description Matching using CLIP

**Objective**: Verify alignment between product images and textual descriptions.

**Methodology**:
- Utilized `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` model
- Encoded images with CLIP vision encoder
- Encoded combined text (title + description) with CLIP text encoder
- Calculated cosine similarity between embeddings
- Flagged products below similarity threshold

**Use Case**: Detects deceptive listings with misleading product images.

**Files**:
- `src/ImageDescriptionMatching/train.py` - Image-text embedding generation
- `src/ImageDescriptionMatching/app.py` - Similarity check API endpoint
- `src/ImageDescriptionMatching/dataloader.py` - Dataset loading utilities

### üîπ Feature 4: Image-Image Matching (Seller vs Reference)

**Objective**: Compare seller-uploaded images against verified reference images.

**Methodology**:
- Created labeled dataset of positive/negative image pairs
- Used CLIP vision encoder for embedding extraction
- Trained 2-layer fully connected classifier on similarity scores
- Binary prediction: Match (1) vs Mismatch (0)

**Application**: Identifies counterfeit listings with doctored or incorrect product photos.

**Files**:
- `src/ImageImageMatching/train.py` - Pairwise training implementation
- `src/ImageImageMatching/app.py` - Image matching API endpoint
- `src/ImageImageMatching/dataloader.py` - Image pair dataset loader

### üîπ Feature 5: Visual Identity Learning with Barlow Twins

**Objective**: Self-supervised learning of product visual identity for counterfeit detection.

**Methodology**:
- ResNet18 backbone with MLP projection head
- Barlow Twins loss function for representation learning
- Enforced similarity between augmentations while maintaining disentanglement
- Cosine distance comparison for identity drift detection

**Advantage**: Operates without labeled counterfeit data using embedding-based anomaly detection.

- Self-supervised training pipeline

### üîπ Feature 6: Product Anomaly Detection via ViT-MAE

**Objective**: Transformer-based masked autoencoding for structural anomaly detection.

**Methodology**:
- Fine-tuned `facebook/vit-mae-base` model
- Trained to reconstruct masked patches from genuine product images
- Anomaly detection through reconstruction loss analysis
- Identifies poor reconstructions indicating counterfeit/tampered products

**Capability**: Detects subtle packaging forgeries and design inconsistencies.
