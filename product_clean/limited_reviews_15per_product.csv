5.0,10.0,"Certain things in the kitchen are worth paying a little more for whether you're an adept chef or just making casual dinners. Knives are one, and without breaking off on a tangent there I highly recommend Wustof or Sebatier. Your pans are most certainly another. All All-Clad series of pans have the important middle layer that helps distrubute heat evenly. What this means to you is better distribution of cooking energy throughout the piece, meaning you can make better use of lower temperatures. The ease of being able to take any All-Clad pot or pan straight from the rangetop to the oven is wonderful, and because the metal handles are less conductive to heat than the body, you're able to pull something right out of the oven (with a mit of course) and hold it much longer than otherwise possible. All-Clad is synonymous with quality, there's no question about that. But a side perk to this series is their aesthetic quality. Particularly in the Copper series, and in my opinion -- certainly in this Stainless set. Mine proudly hang from a ceiling mounted potrack in the middle of my kitchen.
Make no mistake, you can spend less on a set of pans. But no matter what your level of competance in the kitchen, these pans will always raise the bar and allow you make a better product than you would with a lesser set.","Unmatched quality, unrivaled performance and classic appeal.",2023-07-31,424,1422244,1,0.8780355928453201
5.0,23.0,"I was a little skeptical about buying stainless cookware after years of using non-stick pans.  All Clad is amazing.  I've been told for years that this was the best cookware out there and have since become a believer.  For years I could not get the proper browning on food from non-stick pans.  I now realize you cannot get that type of color from a non-stick pan you need a stainless pan.  The food even looked and tasted better.  All clad heated up evenly and the handles stayed cool.  Even better these pans are stick resistant and clean up was really easy.

5.0,0.0,"Its All Clad, what else is there to say?  These pans are wonderful to cook with.  I learned about them when I took a cooking class at our local Chef School.  If I had gas cooking I'd be in heaven, but I have electric coils so these work just fine.  I love cooking with them and they are amazingly easy to clean, even when something gets burned.  I use the same things I use on my Circulon non-stick pots and pans.  If it discolors you just use a little ""barkeepers friend"" cleanser.  I love that I can put these in a hot oven for the ""finish cooking"".  I know these will last me a life time.
They arrive carefully packed in their own little soft bags. I felt like I had received a treasure.
I've been using these pans for about 3 months and I love them.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself, even if you decide to try just one pan.  Well worth the investment.",Perfect set at a great price,2017-07-08,424,993217,0,0.11248488426183
4.0,0.0,"My husband and I have been married 38 years.  For our silver (25th) anniversary, he took me to Marshall Fields to get, you guessed it, silver.  I didn't find anything I liked, so we went to my favorite department, the kitchen section.  After looking at the All-Clad, we decided to call it our ""stainless anniversary.""  After 13 years, I feel qualified to review All-Clad.  I have several stainless, several non-stick, 1 roaster, 1 wok, 4 bread pans, 4 cake pans, 1 oversized non-stick griddle, and some I can't even remember.  They all are absolutely phenomenal when it comes to cooking the final product.  However...There are some things I would add:  First of all, I would add a lip on at least a 1 1/2 qt saucepan.  When you are trying to slowly release the liquid from the pan into something else, the liquid drips down the side, onto the counter, leaving you to release even more slowly or stop altogether, waiting until you can add the liquid again.  Also, I would add a release on the lid, so some steam could come out on those dishes where you don't want to completely cover the pan.  An additional perk would be to add a release, see-through cover and strainer on the lid pan, for cooking small amounts of pasta, beans, rice, etc.  I have also found that the cookware is extremely heavy - if I have a full frypan, it's hard to lift, but that's the tradeoff for having great cookware.",great cookware - missing a couple things,2017-04-23,424,5916979,0,0.2084227954297761
3.0,4.0,"I am not pleased with this set of cookware. I am used to cooking on old cookware that did not stick much and spread the heat evenly. You could expect this from even moderately priced pots. This is no longer the case. I  have spent the extra and bought single pieces from several brands like Calphalon, Neova, enameled steel, enameled iron, I even brought back one from Switzerland with no brand name on it, (which was actually very good). None of them measured up to my Wearever stainless clad aluminum not even this very expensive set. The non stick pots simply put a questionable surface on a useless pot to create a product that satisfies the main complaint. I am careful about what surface I cook on and don't want to use non stick pots, that is an important factor to me and this set of pots did not measure up. The All Clad is good looking and it really is sturdy. but the handles are needlessly long and the lids are flat which is often very inconvenient. The cooking surface does not react the way I expected from such an expensive and hefty set. Food cooks with less heat but you must put up with a fair amount of sticking. After the first use the finish had a dark look to it that only came off with light scrubbing with a stainless steel cleaner.  I think the emphasis overall has been placed on appearance and ruggedness. I thought seriously about  returning this set. I  just did not know what brand would be better after trying so many. I am very disappointed and yearn for my old pots that were over 30 years old and were not discarded because of wear.",Not That Good,2017-02-14,424,4377784,0,0.1229484699589329

Under the impression they were made in America I found they were not all made in America but in CHINA.  The set is nice, looks good and seems to cook nice.  Beware of lids, made in CHINA, as the handle does get hot even though advertised cool touch handles. The lids do not have the same quality as the rest of the set.

5.0,2.0,"I needed to replace my Calphalon nonstick set.  It was starting to not be nonstick anymore, which to me means that we had eaten the Teflon.  Gross, and hopefully we don't get cancer or something!  (We'd bought that set 10 yrs ago for almost $400 thinking it would be a lifetime investment...ha....)

Anyway, I finally settled on this All-Clad set.  All-Clad is the number 1 recommended brand by chefs, and it's made in the USA which is very important to me.  Many people say that Kirkland's stainless sets are comparable (and 1/3 the price), but you get what you pay for usually.  I cook at least 2, sometimes 3, meals per day, so quality and performance are my top priorities.  I'm hoping this new set will be my lifetime set.

It's expensive, yes, but there are ways to get the cost down.  I thought I'd seen it on sale at Macy's, so I went to a small local kitchen shop and told them that.  They wanted my business, so they told me they'd give me this set for $460.  I went home and looked at the Macy's price...$599.  Oops.  But the local shop still gave me the deal.  :)

My hangup was whether to get this set or the copper core.  The owner of that little shop said she has pieces of both and can't tell a difference.  She wished she hadn't spent the money on the copper core (but it is very pretty).

These cook beautifully, and I haven't had any trouble with sticking.  I use a med-high heat, preheating the pan, adding a tiny bit of oil, heat that, and then cook.  The food seems to stick at first, but releases nicely when it's done or ready to be turned.  Cleanup is a breeze.  I'll be adding additional pieces as my budget allows!","So Far, So...Excellent!",2023-12-07,424,4448740,1,0.9157365730711532
4.0,5.0,"The previous radio located at my desk was a $40 Sony radio/CD combo, but I was having trouble getting reception in the middle of the office building where my desk is located. I figured I could justify the extra cost of a nice radio like the Model II or the Bose Wave radio if it could pick up the weak AM stations I wanted. The reviews of the Model II I read stressed the retro look, yet very top-notch tuner of the unit, and this convinced me to give it a try. The radio arrived on a Friday, so I demoed the unit in my living room all weekend via radio and my pioneer CD player.
  First off, the unit is heavy for its size. I like that; maybe that's the wannabe old-school audiophile in me. It has furniture grade wood enclosures that give it a real visual appeal sitting on a shelf. The craftsmanship of this model is also felt with the knobs. They have a weighty feel to them with just the right amount of resistance. My only pet peeve from initial testing would be that the volume knob is touchy at low volumes, making finding the exactly right level of volume for your desk at work tricky sometimes. Also, you'll never have the knob rotated over half way since that's where the limit of clear audio from the speakers is. This short range of rotation makes it seem like you have the Ferrari of little radios with a Ford gas pedal. Regardless, the sound of the Model II is beefy and very convincing for its size at low to medium volume, which makes it perfect for applications like your desk at work or your study at home. I didn't buy the subwoofer (probably overkill for an office desk application), and was worried about the range that the unit could play with clarity, yet I've been surprised so far.
  At my desk at work, I was a little disappointed that stations didn't come in any clearer than with the Sony  of the price. Apparently being 30' from the nearest window was beyond the reach of even this radios capability. Ugh. But, I can hook my workstation up to the Model II and play mp3's or CD's through it by simply flipping the switch over to Aux. I have really enjoyed this feature.
  Overall, this is a high quality yet small unit. I love the retro look, excellent quality finish, and warm-solid sound. It has expandable potential with the optional sub and the Aux in (which I love). But don't buy it for the tuner if you're located just on the edge of reception somewhere, this unit probably won't do any better than your Sony. Still very highly recommended.","Good Radio, Great Aesthetics",2009-07-16,712,1995203,0,0.3493993101813943

5.0,4.0,"I can honestly say I am glad I spent the $150 on this stereo...Its really a bookshelf stereo and not just a table radio and I say that because you get two seperate boxes that look just plain weird side by side on a table and the wires are pure white and they are very long which is a good thing and bad (in otherwords its not hidden if you want it to be) Other than that the sound from this stereo sounds alot like the bose wave music system (the small one my mother has, not the big one) and it sounds a little better than that....(In other words sounds supreme!!!!!)I only have the radio but I am going to get the subwoofer b/c from what I read its really worth it (just like the radio) But for true digital sound for a stereo made for digital music not radio music you have to get an input for digital music (i.e. a dvd/cd/mp3 player) good news is you don't have to by the stupid $200 1 disc cd player from what I read its not worth itr. Instead the table radio has an input aux (actually it has alot of inputs even one for recording) So I plan on buying a multi-disc player (like a 300 disc changer) for $200 instead...

5.0,42.0,"I must say, this radio is simply wonderful.  I can honestly say that there is not another radio that I have heard that can be compared with the Tivoli Model Two.  This radio has a warmth, crispness, and a silky smoothness that mass market plastic stereos simply can not match.
 This radio is very detailed and very musical.  I used the Model Two with the Model Subwoofer and was simply amazed.  The subwoofer is not like the ones in a boom box or small plastic stereo.  The subwoofer simply ads to or extends the bass response of the Model Two table radio.  The subwoofer does not make its presence known.  If you close your eyes and take your thoughts off of the radio itself, the equipment seems to disappear and you are left focusing on the music and not the radio that is playing the music.
 The radio is not a thump box; it is not something that you would jam with.  It is too elegant for that.  The radio is rather better suited for musical enjoyment.  I did not think that I would call a table radio elegant or say that a table radio has a sense of class and style.  The cabinets are made of cherry wood and give the radio an expensive look.
 I can honestly say that if you are looking for a true music system that will bring you music without any hype, fancy displays, and are looking for an excellent bargain, then the Model Two is for you.

5.0,13.0,"The Tivoli Model Two is, without a doubt, the best purchase I have ever made. This unit is insanely good. Having heard the Model One, I decided to purchase the Model Two and the Model Subwoofer. The Model One is an outstanding mono table radio but the Two is better than just a stereo version. There is no remote, no blinking LED's or LCD display. Just the best sounding small stereo system I have heard outside of a Nakamichi system that goes for the price of a used car. Sounds are reproduced clean, clear, and with the addition of the sub, rich and warm. Don't let the small size fool you, this system will fill the room with music. The tuner is excellent, as it should be given the high tech components and geared dial. Setup is a breeze. Plug box b into box a. Plug box c into box a. plug boxes a and c into the wall. You're good to go! If desired plug a cd player into the aux port on box a and hold on. The quality is uniformly excellent and the appearance is an extremely nice retro look that will go great with all but the most modern of decors. For a price of about half of it's more famous competitor it is without a doubt the best deal I know of in small audio. No it can't replace large components for big rooms or home theater but then it's not supposed to. It's made to do one thing: produce great sound from a small package and that it does supremely.

I don't need to repeat the compliments about its sound quality, and the fact it is still running strong after 10 years speaks for its build-quality.

2.0,4.0,"Very excited to have this product -- wanted to replace a failing Yamaha receiver from the late 1980s and my ugly Cambridge Soundworks speakers. Wow, is the Tivoli disappointing.

I have a brand new Model Two, plus the subwoofer, bought at full price.

In a nutshell, it sounds low-end, which is so counter to how it looks.

There's no treble -- it's all midrange. And the subwoofer adds some thumpiness, but nothing pretty.

Also, the second speaker has less output than the main unit. I can adjust for the imbalance using the balance dial hidden on the back of the unit, but that seems absurd, as the speakers are specially designed to work together.

Separately, the radio tuning dial loses accuracy as you move up frequencies. To get 93.9 you have to tune to about 94.1. And to get 105.9, you have to set the dial to about 107. I've never had a radio that didn't have accurate markings -- that just seems like a very cheap mistake that you could easily have been solved for.

4.0,2.0,"The sound is not quite as good as the Model 88 that Kloss designed earlier. But the Model 88 is no longer available so this is a close second. Highs are a bit weaker and perhaps muddier than the Model 88 and you need the subwoofer to approximate as much reach into the low frequencies, which puts the price tag over $450--add in an ipod connector and you're over $525.  The tuner is a retro analogue type so you can get some tuner drift after a while as temp changes affect the capacitance and shift the tuning slightly-- so you might need to retune the station you're listening too every so often.

On the whole, nice looking, well constructed with a very thoughtful design. Listen to as many different units as you can and make your choice based on price and sound.

3.0,8.0,"I am a clean freak.  I pretty much vacuum 2x/week.  I've had this vacuum for a little over a year.  When our last vacuum (Hoover Windtunnel) was on it's last leg, which lasted us about 4 years, I figured I would spend a little extra and get the Dyson.  I hear so much about it and how great its suction power.  Not to mention that I don't have to buy anymore bags and it's great for people with allergies.  My oldest son has asthma, so I was sold on it.

Like I said, I've had this for over a year.  When we first got it, it cleaned so well.  You could actually feel how clean our carpet is, and it cleans tile floors just as well with the attachment.  I was so happy and thought that it was so worth it.  But now that I've had it for 14 months, it doesn't seem to have a powerful suction anymore.  I figured for something that costs this much, it should last me at least 4 years like my Hoover did, if not longer.  I don't know if I am just hard on vacuums or what since I do vacuum a lot, but isn't that what they are made for?

However, to be fair, I do love all the attachments it comes with.  I can safely clean my leather sofa, and chairs with it.  And the attachment for the stairs is wonderful--it really does the job.  I just wish that the suction power is still as good as it was when I first got it.  Dyson does claim that it's the only vacuum that doesn't lose it suction.  And yes, I do clean the filter often and empty the bag before it's even full.",NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT...,2011-09-07,796,5183140,0,0.1550766119539652

5.0,0.0,"I first heard about Dyson from a airline magazine during a recent business trip.  The article was very interesting.  A few days later, my wife indicated that we needed a new vacuum and I started telling her about the Dyson.
At first, the price seems high, relative to other cleaners.  We also have two yellow labs that shed through out the year.  It was down to the dogs or me.  Dog hair on the rugs, hair on the furniture, hair everywhere.  The cleaner arrived in 13 days after it was ordered.  It took about ten minutes to put the Animal together.  My daughter and I followed the directions.

We first tried the vacuum in the upright position in our living room, which had been vacuumed about four days earlier.  The machine picked up so much dog hair and dust that it filled up the canister about half way.  We both were very surprised.  We then tried the hair attachment on the furniture.  It took some effort but the dog hair was removed.  Our next challenge was the steps going up stairs.  The wand attachment worked as advertised.  We got to the top, while the Animal stayed at the landing.  The design of the hose attachment is very clever. We have not tried the ZORB cleaner or the spot remover at this point.  These items come with Purple Animal.
The furniture attachment and the hard surface attachment are loose items and do not attach directly to the animal when not in use.  The 3 smaller attachments attach directly to the Animal.
This device is very well designed.  The construction is very good.  The appearance is a bit different but you get use to it quickly.  The animal is easy to use, and very easy to clean.  There are no bags and no mess to deal with.
Overall, this is a very good machine and the best vacuum that we have ever owned.  Yes, it was worth the cost.  And yes, the dogs can stay.","The purple monster lives up to it's name! ""The Animal""",2023-05-23,797,4633610,1,0.5364449727600942
4.0,10.0,"As far as carpet vacuums go, this one is outstanding. Other functions work, but not as well, and they're not terribly convenient.
The first impression upon opening the box is: man, this is a LOT of plastic ... but then you lift it, and discover the motor must be made of lead. Fortunately, the unit rolls easily on its rear wheels, and the heft likely helps the unit get ""down and dirty"" with the carpet. It does this exceedingly well, and switches easily to the bare floor. The generous length of power cord means you don't have to stop often just to change outlets.
On the downside, it's a bit cumbersome to change to a tool other than the main power sweeper. Attaching the too-small dust brush directly to the hose (after first extracting the long wand from said hose) is not very satisfying, since the whole time you're dusting you feel the hose trying to pull back from you.
There are plenty of other nits as well, but I think I'll keep this unit, because it's so darned good doing the carpets. My old Electrolux was much more convenient to use, but I am certain that it did not clean nearly as well.","not perfect, but great for carpets",2008-05-29,797,1471899,0,0.3238657767383814

5.0,21.0,"I have gone through so many vacuums that claim to clean better than the rest.  After 2 Fantoms and a Eureka I think I have finally found my vacuum.  I couldn't believe how much dirt is hiding in my carpets.  With 2 dogs and 1 cat it's pretty difficult to keep all the pet hair off the carpets.  This is the only vacuum that actually has easy to use attachments.  My other vacuums would seem to lose the attachments after about a couple of months, and they never really had the suction power to clean stairs well.  The animal pet hair attachment is amazingly powerful and cleaned the steps as if I took the upright on them.

It seems like a lot to pay for a vacuum, but it was either this or break down and get a Kirby.  Although it may seem like a high price to pay, it's well worth every penny at how great a job it does.  I would recommend it to anyone who has had a problem with a vacuum in the past and wants a trouble free vacuum in the future.

Ten years later, lots of cleaning it out, servicing it at a local shop and it still runs great. Who knew a vacuum could be such a utility?",A++ in my book!,2023-03-09,797,220299,1,0.6811479276915708
5.0,59.0,"Dyson is smart to highlight the story of the invention of this vacuum. It really appeals to me that someone took a hard look at a product that wasn't working to its capacity and redesigned it, then fought against the big boys to sell it.
First of all, this vacuum is so beautiful that we keep it out all the time. In the main room of our house. The colors are a matter of personal taste, to be sure, but it really is a thing of beauty.
My previous experience with bagless vacuums left me feeling they are rather cheaply made. The Dyson is a rock. The tools fit snugly and smartly. Once you give the instructions a careful read, everything makes sense (unlike when I first looked at the machine in a store, pressed the wrong button and the canister fell off).
Not only is it easy to empty, but when you decide to give the canister a thorough cleaning, that's easy too. There is also a washable (HEPA?) filter, but I haven't had to wash that yet.
Here are my comments:
1. Strange as it sounds, I like the sound of this vacuum.
2. I had an Electrolux with a retractable cord. That is in some ways nicer than a wind-around cord like the Dyson has. No big deal.
3. If I were elderly, I might balk at having to carry this upstairs. Maybe it's for younger and stronger folks.
4. I got the purple monster because we are considering getting a pet and I thought the pet hair attachment would be useful, but I haven't used it yet. Furthermore, I think I recall looking at the literature that I could have ordered it separately from the vacuum. I guess my point is that if you prefer the yellow or red models, you could still get the pet attachment at a later time.
5. I only have one real criticism of this wonderful product, and that concerns the hose and long wand that forms the handle. There are three ways to use the attachments:
1. Wand mode: this is where the attachments go on the end of the wand handle and you draw the whole thing out
2. Hose mode: you remove the wand and the attachment goes right on the end of the hose.
3. Reverse wand: you remove the wand from the hose, attach the hose to the end of the wand handle and put the attachment on the silver end of the wand.
COMMENTS:
1. Wand mode: I find that when I'm using the attachments, the hose angle sometimes is too much at the end of the wand and suction gets cut off.
2. Hose mode: this is my favorite way of using most attachments because I can hold the attachment close to its end for maximum control.
3. Reverse wand mode: this is useful for stairs, and I don't seem to have the problem with the hose angle as with ""wand mode""; however, it's hard to use the brush and crevice tools in this mode because you're holding onto a wand that is like 3.5 feet long, and this little tool is at the end...it's hard to control.",A Quality Product,2023-03-31,797,3975214,1,0.7995696904365606

Truly, this is the best suction I have seen. The other major brands can not come close to the steadiness of suction the Dyson has. On the first turn it sucked out 6 cups of dog hair and yucky stuff. I had vacuumed with my other brand 2 days before using the Dyson. The Animal tool that comes with the DCO7 works well. Dog hair is difficult to remove from upholstery. This special tool has brushes that are suction activated and just wisk the hair off your chairs. No bags to purchase is a bonus. The attachments are very easy to use. The hose stretches out beautifully for the attachment use. Vacuuming area rugs are no problem as long as the rug is heavy. I was very pleased with the Dyson's transition from carpeting to linoleum. Turned off the brushes and it cleared all hair, crumbs without kicking the ""stuff"" out from under. If the cord was retractable this would be the ultimate. Maybe their next model. It is a bit pricey but, no bag purchase helps with savings over the long haul. If your looking for a high quality vacuum and have pets this would make most people very happy. The only down side is the weight. It could be a bit hard to handle for the more physically challenged. Otherwise the consistent suction is most impressive.","Searched Long, Finally Found the Sucker!",2023-09-15,797,1769860,1,0.7266245663220999

Each tray comes in an open ended plastic bag. I decided to keep those for storage so when placed together they will not get scratched by each other or other items.

These have to be the best tray I've ever used. I just got out of the kitchen making some Christmas kookies for the first use on these.

I made 3 dozen perfect mint-chocolate chip kookies. I did not grease or spray the trays, although the kookies have a lot of butter in them so NOT one stuck to the tray, not even the chips. I mean I could lift them off without a spatula, although I had to use one so as not to burn my fingers. I could even remove them almost immediately upon removing them from the oven, within seconds, but the kookies needed to kool some first to become firm. Even small thin amounts of dough dropped at random, on purpose, that got really dark brown just slid off.

I found the design to aid in kookie placement. The Calphalon name is pressed into the center of the tray. I started with placing a kookie on each end of this, then another centered between those and the ends of the tray. This gave a nice row of 4 down the middle of the tray. Placing the next two rows was easy to line up and gave me a nice placement of 12 so none stuck together. There probably was room for a little more but this worked perfectly.

I noticed no warping when placing room temperature trays into the hot over or when removing them to kool or then placing the kool tray under hot water, these can handle it.

Kleenup was a snap. I barely had to wash them, probably could have done with just a paper towel, but I did lightly run a soapy sponge, no scrubbing, across the surface and ran hot water on them, which just rolled off. The where almost dry before even placing on the drain board.

This was the bestest batch of kookies I have ever made. I may buy another set because I love these so much and will make making kookies more fun and get rid of all my other previous brands.

Update: November 2010
Still love my Calphalon. Best investment in bakeware/cookware ever made. After 4 years of use, my pans are still in mint condition. They have never failed to help produce the best cookies, always easy to clean. In fact after 4 years of use, there is not a sign of ever being used, still as perfect as the day I got them.

5.0,170.0,"First, let me just say that prior to buying the Miele Antares, I owned a different (""low-end"") Miele vacuum for 16 years. I ran it all the time, it was totally ahead of its time in terms of performance and style, and I never once serviced it.

However, after 16 years, it needed minor servicing, and though they told me at the shop that it still had some life left in it (the vacuum store told me that Miele motors are built to last for 20 years), I decided to trade in my old Miele and upgrade to the Antares. WOW! This unit is amazing. It's quiet, it's lighter, it has variable settings for suction power, and it's really powerful. I highly recommend investing in the add-on turbo brush ($100), especially if you have pets. (I hate to vacuum, but I do have pets, and the turbo brush literally scrubs the fur out of your carpet.)

But even if you own an old Miele, like my previous one, you could just buy the turbo brush and add it on--the Miele design is consistent enough that often the same components can be used for multiple models, covering a wide span of years (for example, the Antares uses exactly the same vacuum cleaner bags that my 16-year-old Miele used).

I recommend that you don't waste your time with vacuum cleaners that will only last 3-5 years. Read the user reviews online of other competing products that don't last nearly as long, and then buy a Miele.",A great investment and worth the price,2023-12-15,2764,5824385,1,0.7498541182694805
2.0,0.0,"I bought the Miele Neptune to replace mmy Eureka upright.  The selling points for me were the ""closed system"" that traps dust and keeps it from being spit back out into the air (and this machine does a GREAT job of keeping the dust trapped!) and the fact that it wasn't loud (I HATE the high-pitched-whining-noise that most vacuum's make and was willing to pay more to avoid subjecting myself to the grating/blood-boiling noise similar machines put out).

The Neptune does a GREAT job dusting and the parquet attachment is great on wood floors, but I can't give it a higher rating because the turbo-head does a terrible job on area rugs.  My house is mostly hard wood floors and tile, with a few large area rugs so I'm going to keep the vacuum because I can use this to easily get all of the dust/cat hair without reducing the air quality in my home, but it looks like I'll have to keep my Eureka upright to use on my area rugs -- not exactly what I expected from a vacuum that cost $500.

Note for those of you with cats/ dealing with cat hair:  the Neptune does a great job picking up the cat-hair-dust-bunnies that live under your furniture, and when you turn the Neptune on, you won't traumatize your cats!  ;)",Hard to Rate...

5.0,2.0,"Bought this vacuum as a replacement for a 10-year old miele that was (still working perfectly) lost in a recent move. Happy to report that the new vacuum, which is about half the size of the original works just as well and in some ways we like it better: it is much smaller and therefore easier to store. It has a no interior compartment for the accessories, which enables the size reduction as well as the curvy redesign that helps the vacuum manuever around furniture and under tables. It has a simple mechanical foot pedal on the floor/rug tool that makes it simple to switch back and forth from rug to bare wood or tile floors; it has a remote control on the vacuum arm that increases and decreases the power so that you do not have to bend over and dial up the power on the canister (and, boy, does it have power!). And last, it is HEPA compliant -- there are three different levels of filters that you can apply -- which our family appreciates because it works so well at reducing the impact from dust and other allergens.","Small vacuum, big powerhouse",2023-05-16,2764,5517584,1,0.6606177106220931

Between the two floor attachments, it works for every floor in the house and picks up dirt as well as any machine we've ever used.  It's also relatively quiet for a vacuum cleaner, without sacrificing power.  And the fact that the spinning carpet brush works by suction rather than by motor is a plus, since there is one less thing to go wrong (as it did with our previous Hoover).

3.0,18.0,"I have had three Nespresso machines for a long time now and use them a lot. My comments concern the Nespresso system rather than any particular machine.

The idea of the capsules rather than using coffee beans requires some trade offs, but has lots of huge advantages. The capsules are super convenient, fast, clean and neat, attractive, and allow you to easily serve a variety of coffee blends (decaf, Latin American, African, pure Arabica, etc, which is fun). A big advantage is that they stay fresh for months at a time, so you can always have them on hand when you need them.

Comparing the Nespresso system with the conventional system shows the value of convenience. Conventional machine: you have to have fresh beans, you have to have an expensive burr grinder (more counter space, more to clean, more to break down), you have to get the fineness of the grind correct, you have to measure the ground coffee accurately, you have to tamp the coffee in the holder correctly, you have to pour the correct amount of water through. This requires a large amount of time, effort, experimentation, patience, and experience. Serving a party of 10 people like this could easily take you an hour, and you are making a lot of noise and not enjoying the party, and making a big mess to clean up later.

A conventional machine could never be used in your office or company kitchen, but a Nespresso machine works out very nicely in that situation.

On the downside, 45 cents or more (for special editions) per shot of espresso is a little expensive compared to doing it with beans. You are limited to the Nespresso capsules, nothing else will come close to working. This means you can't try out the interesting jars of beans at your local coffee shop. There may come a day when the capsules are not available, but I don't see that happening.

The big downside is the quality of the espresso produced by the capsules, and therein is my main gripe. After many years they have recently expanded their offerings from 10 varieties or 15 or so. I haven't tried all the new ones, but I didn't really like any of the old ones. Most of them include some Robusta coffee beans in the blend. That's unusual because gourmet coffee is 100% Arabica, and my opinion is the Robusta is a problem. I have to wonder if Nespresso is trying to cut costs in this most critical aspect of an otherwise first-rate system. However, once or twice a year Nespresso releases a ""special blend"" for a limited time. This is usually 100% Arabica. In 1998 and 1999, the special blend was very good. In 2000 it was bad but then they released another one in June 2001 that was very good.  They have a new, more expensive line of coffees that I haven't yet explored.

The final alternative is the ""super-automatic"" style machine, that with a single button push automatically grinds the beans, measures, tamps, pours the espresso, and dumps out the spent grounds. That's great but it requires fresh beans and that's a problem for me. I think maybe a food vacuum sealer might solve that problem.

One final comment: Don't fool yourself into thinking that a machine at home, no matter how nice, is going to save you money at Starbucks. Nothing can replace that fad inducing experience.","Great machine and system, but mediocre capsules",2010-08-02,2962,4215651,0,0.4422442731383871

Now for the strange stuff.  The coffee comes in special capsules, basically only available through the online Nespresso Club, where you are asked for the serial number of your machine and name of the seller.  When I indicated that I had bought mine online, I was given a list of sellers that didn't include the one I had actually used (sorry Amazon).  So I had to lie.  I couldn't see the prices of the coffee until I had ""joined"" the club.
This whole process [surprised that they didn't ask me for my kids' names] left me with such a bad taste that if I had known what I was in for, I would have bought a different brand.

5.0,7.0,"I used to spend about $25 a week on buying Mochas at Starbuck's or Pete's, but since I received this as a gift at the end of last year, I've been saving a lot of money. The capsules are about 55cents a piece. Translation: For what I was spending in about 2 weeks going every weekday I now get a daily supply of 3-shot mochas for the entire month.

The machine itself is very simple to use. There's no mess like with non-capsule machines, and you get a consistent cup of espresso. Toss in a little steamed milk and chocolate and I'm good to go. Operation is simple: fill the reservoir, hit one button to turn it on and wait 'til the red light stops blinking (about 15-30 seconds), open the top to insert the capsule and close it, and hit one button to fill your cup. When you go to insert the next capsule the act of opening the top engages a lever that drops the spent capsule in a hidden discard bin, that holds about 12 capsules, that's also simple to pop out and dump in the trash -- no messy hands, no coffee grounds spill, ever.

The Nespresso people realize the machines are expensive and they want your business, and they treat you right because of it. I got a call about a month and a half after I had the machine just to check if it was operating well. I've heard of a few people getting machines that go out after a month or two, but with the Nespresso Concepts D290 machine, I think I've found a real winner. Where I live (the suburbs), it takes about 2 days for replacements capsules to arrive, so you're never without coffee long if you do run out.

4.0,5.0,"This Godinger Crystal Gavel totally evokes authority and spirituality. Although it isn't really usable for hammering with any force, it looks great in the hand when posing in front of the mirror, or for the neighbors through the living room picture window. I like to hold it over my head with both hands like I'm about to leap off the coffee table and spark an earthquake or a housefire with one swipe of my tiny mallet--or hold it at arm's length in front of me while my other hand flaps my cape out behind me like it's fluttering in the maelstrom. I used to feel kind of ridiculous using my dad's ball peen, but the delicate feel of this Crystal Gavel adds a sense of authenticity to my costume. It's like half mystical talisman, half quality faceted fashion accessory, and half paperweight.

Yes, we all know that this little hammer is made of something that causes cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm in the State of California, but I live in Michigan where we are hardened by winter, where it's nothing at all like California.

As other reviewers have pointed out, it does refract the light quite well, but I like to think of it as being especially good for blinding the Mindless Ones as they cross into our realm from the Dark Dimension. And for burning ants in the sun.

EDIT: While Amazon won't let me re-rate in terms of stars, let me tell you here that this gavel, while fanciful and stylish, is not the sturdiest of items. The head is attached to the handle by what appears to be a dot of superglue.

5.0,12.0,"Originally I bought this as a thank you gift for my uncle Stetson, the judge, after he managed to get me free off those bogus drug charges that I was tagged with that night with Tiffany and Cabbage in the Dumser's Dairyland parking lot. I figured it was the least I could do, especially since it wasn't the first time Uncle Stet used his considerable weight here in Worcester County to keep me outta Snow Hill. Tiffany always gets me into those kinda scrapes - you know how it is - she ain't that fine but she steady and ready. And Cabbage - those seasonal OC college boy rentacops love to hassle a tatted up freak like him.

So, anyway, I figured I buy this crystal gavel for Uncle Stet - thought it'd look nice in that wood-paneled office of his - he got a big-ole oak desk w/ brass lamps and placks and degrees on the walls - give the room that last classey touch like the chandeleer at the Clarion buffet.

But when it showed up (in just three days - real speedy delivery) Cabbage and I were enjoying an afternoon smoke session and once I took it out, the rays from the sliding glass door hit it just right and a rainbow shot out just like that pyramid on the cover of Dark Side of the Moon - then, of course Cabbage had to break out the Floyd - and once Floyd was on - is there anybody out there - we had to visit Jay-9 down on St. Louis for some more party favors - by the time we got back we was in full effect - and Cabbage pretends like he's a judge and not only busts it but also Wolves' glass coffee table.

I was sick and tired of the daily grind and needed a change.  No one seemed to be listening to me and so I thought a gavel would be the perfect solution.  I needed to voice my authority. But in a gentle way, just symbolically, really, so what better than this crystal gavel.  I also appreciated the honesty of the description:""This wonderful gavel, although not usable, makes a great paperweight."" I thought, perfect, I can just have it resting on my desk and all I'd need to do is look at it in the presence of others and they would sense my command in the world--as well as my elegance (crystal!).  I give this four out of five, however, because it turned out to be less noticeable than I had hoped and just having it sit on my desk was not producing the reaction I had hoped for. On hindsight, maybe, as the other reviewers mentioned, it was the reflective qualities that were actually temporarily blinding my coworkers.  At the time, however, I just thought it was a failure (just like me).  Then, disregarding the warning, I decided to put the gavel to use, and so I gently tapped my desk after one more day where I tried to speak and everyone ignored me as usual.  To my surprise, this gavel more than worked,and they probably claim it isn't usable because of court action in the past.  Well, I tapped that gavel and it was even better than people paying attention to me.  They disappeared! And I found myself surrounded by scary puppets, in a dark (literally) world. It was a hard six months of trying to track down this beautiful gavel (the puppets grabbed it from me and ran as soon as I entered their world), but after many setbacks, and amputations, I did retrieve it--and with just a tap of that gavel I was back at work, so grateful for my anonymity.

I do a lot of drinking and internet purchasing (and am on several antibiotics [for life, long story]) so I in no way blame Amazon for the mix-up. I held the gavel up to a powerful light source. My retina detached, the left one. Again. I'm not blaming Amazon though a warning might be in order, or should I say appreciated. Speaking of omens and murder via witchcraft, are you aware this item contains this exact warning:

WARNING:  This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.

I guess you are aware since the link is actually on the product description. I am not concerned about reproductive harm because I consider kids toad-like, toads that suck the Time and Soul and Free Will from the individual, but the cancer thing would blow, hard.

After the second eye surgery, I returned the gavel. Amazon was very cool in refunding my money, like always. I am giving the gavel a 4, understandably. I'm not complaining. The last few weeks since the gavel's arrival have expanded my life, in the way of near death experiences, or underage mistresses, etc.

Within the judge's marble stand, the dancing baby is carved in bas relief. Callista Flockhart's hair shimmers in brilliant goldleaf.

Think of the scent as a soft, powdery sage with notes of citrus.

While Yankee Candles are not inexpensive, they do last far longer than any others I've bought.  They burn right down to the very bottom of the jar and the scent is as true as when you first lit the wick of your new jar.

We live in a home with an open floor plan.  Being such a large space, you might expect the candle to scent just a limited area.  Pleasantly, that's not the case.

I read all reviews, both pros and cons, and decided to try this mattress as a replacement for our old spring mattress.  My husband and I went first to the leading mattress stores and tried out the best (?) foam mattress they had.  Very nice!  And, we discussed on the way home about any noticeable smell as, generally, that was the biggest complaint given on Amazon reviews.  Both agreed the smell was not decernable, however, we did not know how long the mattress had been standing on the shop floor. Well, at less that 20% percent of the store price my husband told me to go ahead and pick one off of Amazon and this one is it.
DO- do your shopping first by trying one of these foam beds in a reputable mattress store!  You must be aware that they are firm and the feel is quite different from a inner spring mattress. Having done that; feel is good, and smell doesn't concern you too much, I'd say go ahead and purchase it from Amazon.
My comments are (1) mattress arrived in a timely manner, exactly as stated rolled up and packed tightly.  My husband and I, (both in our 60's) were able to get it up the stairs and onto our box spring. (2)(Caution - this mattress is HEAVY!)(3)It upfolded quickly as in under 3 hours and (4)the smell was there but minor problem to us.
 We left it in our spare bedroom for a week and then switched mattresses from spare room to  ours. Perfect! Smell pretty much gone (unless you stick your face right in it).  I got a soft bed topper to cushion the firmness somewhat.  Added really comfy sheets.  Bliss!  I like the fact that I no longer feel like I am always rolling into my hubby, who is half again my size and there is no bouncing around when either he or I move around.  My four year old grandson came to stay with us when his whole family, including him, had the flu last week and he wanted to sleep in our bed.  Seriously,  we had a really hard time getting him out of the bed.  His mom called to check on him and he said he wanted in stay at our house because he was soooo comfy in our bed.  And little kids don't lie about something like that.  After five days of illness, that was the first time I saw that child sound asleep. I know it wasn't just the bed, but it helped and he never once mentioned the smell.  Also, he has minor breathing problems, (since birth) and there was no reaction to this mattress.  So.
If you want a very reasonable priced mattress, want firmness and support with no bounce and are not too sensitive to smell.  This mattress could be a very good fit.  We are very pleased.","Hard giving 5 stars, but...,",2023-10-16,7001,319420,1,0.9089671143960812

Packaging - Despite reading all reviews before ordering, I was still slightly surprised at how small the package was.  Heavy? Yes, but a pretty tight roll considering the mattress size.  Unwrapping was easy and it quickly rose to nearly full size.  We let the mattress sit for a few days while we were on a short vacation (Dynasty says 1-2 hours needed to reach full size) and when we returned, the mattress was full size and had NO off-gassing smell.  I didn't smell it when we it arrived and haven't yet.  I guess we are home free.

Comfort - As with any memory foam mattress, DO NOT expect a soft, pillowy feel.  It can feel a bit firm  initially, but you sink right in to a perfect comfort level.  I am an average sized guy (200 lbs) and my wife is pretty small (100 lbs).  We are both sleeping like the dead since it has arrived.

After owning the mattress for quite some time now, I have a solid conclucion about it. For the price, there isn't much that one could complain about. I do have upper back pain if I fall asleep on my side, the memory foam isn't very forgiving. As far as sleeping on my back of stomache, the mattress is great, no back pain. Like I said, though, if you are a side sleeper, this may not be for you unless you intend on purchasing another memory foam topper do your shoulders can have a little more support. The mattress itself is pretty comfortable once you get use to it, but it is easy to fall asleep on it the wrong way and wake up feeling uncomfortable.

I used to have a cheap basic rice cooker with bare minimum functions (cooks rice, steam veggie-which I don't, keep warm), as a result of being a poor student. However I don't think I will never go back to those basic ones after I experienced how rice should be made and taste using this rice cooker!  Really, it's worth paying for a great rice cooker like this.

My favorite feature is that it makes an excellent short-grain brown rice.  I do love white short-grain rice (a.k.a. sushi rice), but I alternate with short-grain brown rice sometimes.  Usually, brown rice takes forever to cook, and it's much drier than short-grain white rice, and it's hard to eat those non-sticky rice with chopsticks (I can't separate rice and chopsticks!). But this machine makes the most fluffy and moist brown rice I have ever had! And I just set the timer in the morning, and I never have to wait all night for the brown rice to be cooked!

It arrived as promised and was perfectly packaged as if it had never been opened, not even cosmetic damage. However...it did not work at all! I was totally amazed that amazon had not even bothered to check that the item was in working order before trying to sell it as an 'open box return"". The original purchaser had noted all of their info in the warrantee section of the owners manual and I suspect they knew it was not working. I am writing this review because although amazon made the return easy, they never addressed the issue of why they wouldn't test a returned item before selling it again. For as much as the price may be tempting, I will never use warehouse deals again. If an item is totally inoperative, why would they even try to sell it?

5.0,4.0,I spent a lot of time looking over all the rice cookers. I wanted one that would cook 1 cup of rice well as some of the bigger rice cookers are not good at doing small amounts. I also wanted brown rice and a vegetable steaming option. This does all that with the addition of a great slow cooker. This uses a separate bowl & lid so you can keep your rice from being contaminated by anything you cook in the slow cooker. The bowl & lid are easy to clean as is the unit. The only thing that I was a little unhappy with was that I wanted this grey version rather than the white one to match my kitchen however the power lead and plug are white! which looks a little odd when plug in - I tend to put it away if not using for a few days.

5.0,17.0,"I recently purchased this Sanyo rice cooker and have been very satisfied. I have used it for making regular white rice, as well as rinse-free rice (eg. Uncle Ben's), and it has made perfect rice. As well as using water for the cooking liquid, I often use a good chicken stock instead, to give the rice extra flavor.

My favorite use for the cooker is to use a rinse-free rice, add chicken stock according to the cooker's directions (I do prefer to use the ""one-quarter more liquid method""--see rice cooker directions for more info), and, after adding the liquid, putting in some chopped onion and/or other fresh vegetables such as celery and carrots, with a little salt and pepper. This makes a wonderful, healthy side-dish for any meal!

Since everyone has their own preferences for type and texture of their cooked rice, it is wonderful that this particular cooker has enough versatility and features to accommodate many tastes and preferences.

I have not yet tried to make brown rice, but I am looking forward to using the cooker for that type of rice, also. This is definitely worth the few extra dollars it costs, and it comes with a nice little cook book, as well, with some interesting recipes.

Comes out perfect every time!!! Not a single burnt or stuck to the pot grain so far. Just follow the instructions and that's it! Though it is just the husband and myself we got the 5.5 cup cooker because we will use if for dinner parties and future children.

5.0,41.0,"I bought this model to replace my $12 reject rice cooker.  Clearly, a hundred bucks does make a bit of a difference, the most obvious and pleasing of which is the thick, non-stick cooking vessel.  There are two that come with this appliance, a rice cooker with graduations for different kinds of rice, and a slow cooker, both non-stick.  No more soaking with soap and attacking the pan with a scouring pad after every batch of rice.  Being an electronic rice cooker, the other noteworthy advantages over its cheapo predecessor are the timer function and truly hands-off operation, which translates into more food being prepared at home.  If it costs $8-10 to buy a modest lunch, and perhaps a dollar or so to prepare one in the cooker (which is likely more nutritious anyway,) the savings quickly add up.  Using a device like this to prepare meals really saves time.

So far, I've cooked several flawless batches of brown rice, a process that the manufacturer has made near-absolutely idiot-proof.  There's no point going into detail here--just read and follow the instructions and you'll get a nicely-made batch.  I also used the high slow-cook setting to prepare some buckwheat, which came out fine, but the quicker rice-cooking modes will work equally well on buckwheat or other grains with some experimentation.  Dig around online to find recipes.  I look forward to making some soups with this thing.

It worked on apples, Celary, Carrots, Beets, Bracoli, Coconut ( Got oil from the nuts ), cuccumber, Ash gaurd, Oranges ( Yes peel the orange and Juice it works great ), strawberries, grapes, Kiwi and pineapples. The machine worked less efficient on pineapple. With pineapple, it gave less juice and it took a long time for the pineapple to pass through the machine.

Cleanign was tnot bad at all. Cleaning he twin gears takes less than a minute. Cleaning the stainless screen takes may be about a minute plus with the given brush. There is too much concern about it takes time to clean the screen. I guess it is part of juicing.

4.0,94.0,"Angel Juicer:

INCREDIBLE Juice Yield. The pulp is super dry.
(I use to have a Breville Juice Fountain Plus- The pulp from the Breville(Centrifugal Force Juicer) was very wet. Breville would juice Carrots, Cucumbers, Apples, Even Kale pretty well producing 60% Juice and 40% Pulp. But the Breville was unbelievably easy to clean by comparison. After a year of juicing with the Breville, I got my cleanup time to about 3-4 minutes and then stuck it in the dishwasher and it was ready to go the next day)

Angel Juicer- I can not stress this enough, but the pulp was extremely dry. The angel juices spinach + other greens, brocolli, etc. very very well. It is time consuming to juice since the feed chute is smaller than the breville and the juiceman.

I estimate that the angel produces between 75-85% juice of whatever vegetable or fruit you put in. Even though it seems like you get only 15-20% more juice, the quality is far, far, far, superior than the Breville and the Juiceman.

Now for the bad part:
The cleanup for the angel is way longer. Initially, when I first used the angel juicer, it took me 35 mins to clean. Especially if you juice carrots, the pulp gets lodged inside the holes in the screen.
I originally purchased the angel juicer because I figured there are only 3 parts to clean (2 twin gears and 1 screen). The plus side is that the gears are very easy to clean, just pour water on it and the pulp just rinses away.
The screen is a different story altogether. The screen Length is very long which is great for getting a high juice yield but tough to clean. Your hands can not reach all the way inside so you have to use the included brush and then scrub scrub scrub for a very long time.

(However, I have not tried putting it in the dishwasher or used vinegar to clean it because the juicer is expensive and I did not want the juicer to be damaged with high heat from the dishwasher.)

My recommendation: Its an ok Juicer, I am not sure if I will juice everyday if the total time to juice is over 40 minutes (minimum).
For me, I am going back on the hunt to find a juicer that juices greens as well as the angel does but takes half the time to clean. Hope this helps. :-)

Update April-2012-  sorry for the late update.  Over the years I have used the juicer 3 times/week avg.  I must say the Juicer is incredibly resilient.  I have not had to order any of the Juicer's replacement parts. The original parts are still going strong.  The included brush however, came apart w/in 7 months of use (the plastic handle kept coming out of the metal + the brush was flimsy) .  I ordered from the company, a couple of cleaning brushes ($25 ea) and a Silicone O-Ring ($7) (Great to prevent spills).  The new cleaning brush is AMAZING, much sturdier, you can ram the thing in the screen, scrub as hard as you want.  Initially, when I bought the juicer,  I was not used to the gear-type juicers now the total time to juice INCLUDING cleaning takes me about 20-22 min.  (2 min to prep, 8 min to juice,  7 min to clean, 2-4 min to reassemble/put everything away.  Overall, I upgraded my review from 3 stars to 4.5 stars.

4.0,358.0,"This quality juicer is a beast of a machine that squeezes every last drop out of anything you want to juice.

The Angel is a pleasure to use, easy to clean and creates delicious drinks with 2-3 times more juice (and nutrients) than any juicer I have owned.

JUICE

The most important part of a juicer, juice from the Angel tastes delicious and makes too much to drink!

I make a Dr. Oz ""Fresh"" Juice daily, using celery, apple, spinach, cucumber, lemon, lime, ginger and parsley.  Using 1kg (35 ounce) of ingredients the Angel Juicer returns 894gms (31 ounce) of juice, making it almost 90% efficient at extracting liquid from the mentioned ingredients.

The Angel excels at leafy greens, but is also very impressive with fruits.  Pomegranate juice is highly recommended, to make you strong like bull!

Orange, pineapple or grapes are almost as yum, and as there is very little pulp ejected, juices taste more flavoursome and have a consistency better than any I have tried from another juicer, carton or juice bar.

There is very little foam produced perhaps around 2-5% of total juice content.

The Angel also makes soy milk, nut butters and seed juice, although I have never made these.

EASE OF USE

The Angel is quickly and easily assembled with a simple on and off function, however it is slower than a centrifugal juicer in extracting juice.

The twin screws quietly and slowly chew the juice out rather than spinning it out at high speeds like a centrifugal juicer.  This is a Rolls-Royce juicer for a luxurious drink, if you want a fast drink buy a Ferrari Breville juicer or something.

If produce is inserted too quickly, a mushy goop at the bottom of the feeding shoot appears and eventually a couple of drops will leak from the clamping mechanism.  This is the biggest annoyance I have encountered with the juicer, but rarely problematic if produce is inserted slowly enough.

So, instead of washing, cutting and juicing all the fruit/vegetables at the same time, I find it easier to chop then juice, chop then juice, giving the Angel ample time to squeeze everything out, taking less than 5 minutes all up, for 1kg of Fresh Juice.

You can put things like apple seeds into the twin gears without change in taste to the juice, but many lemon seeds make a juice bitter.

CLEANING

To make the machine spotless takes a good few minutes.  All non-motor parts except for the screen mesh need just a quick wash under the tap(faucet)

Other reviewers stated finding it difficult to clean the screen, and it can be awkward at first, but much less so than centrifugal juicers with their myriad of parts and clamps.  I found the screen much easier to clean if liquidy produce, such as lemon, is juiced after more fibrous produce such as celery.

Then only a wash under the tap with a few scrapes on the outside and a few scrubs on the inside (with the included scraper and brush) is needed.  When juicing pomegranates, everything washes away with a quick splash with no scrubbing required.

As everything is stainless steel, there are no plastic bits to discolour, meaning that everything looks brand new if wiped clean with a dry cloth.  After months of use the juicing parts do not have a single water mark, scratch or stain on them, but the stainless steel motor unit has a couple of faint water marks which may be annoying if you are a perfectionist like me.

After a few months of daily use, a slight calcium residue appeared on the juicing parts but a vinegar soak and a toothbrush, as per the manual instructions, dealt with that.

BUILD QUALITY

The motor unit is a monster with a 5 year warranty, but like most quality products I expect it to last much longer than the stated guarantee.  Both the motor and the twin screws are very heavy and sturdy feeling.  In comparison the mesh screen is very light, but is strong and its weight beneficial when cleaning.  The wooden plunger is of excellent quality, as it has not stained or split at all.

The plastic juice and pulp containers however, are weak, scratched quickly from cleaning and stain if left dirty.  The benefits of having an all stainless steel juicer means no contact with (potentially toxic or gender bending) plastics, and promoted in detail on the Angel website, so why a cheap plastic container was provided is beyond me.

I replaced the plastic juice container with a 1 litre Pyrex jug which works better as a juice receptacle.

When switched on the Angel is remarkably quiet, with most of the noise coming from the internal cooling fan.  During use, the Angel is a little noisier than a loud fridge, but much, much quieter than a centrifugal juicer, ie. you can still hold a conversation or listen to music.

GOOD:  Easily makes wonderful tasting and copious amounts of juice.

BAD:  Have to chop-up and insert fruits and vegetables slower than a centrifugal juicer.

UGLY:  Should replace el-cheapo plastic jug with a glass one.
  Water marked stainless steel motor unit deducts one star.

In short- Buy this product if you can afford it and love vegetable juices.  If you can't afford it, and you are serious about juicing, save up.

4-stars because for the price it should be perfect, but the Angel makes 5 star juice.

PS. YouTube ""Angel Juicer"" to see it in action.

***UPDATE***

Years later, I'm still loving this beauty and the juice it makes.  A few minor issues haven't affected my very enjoyable juice making experience, and I would still highly recommend this excellent juicer.

4.0,32.0,"Let's go over what I found that I've liked about this juicer.

1) Excellent job at greens which we do a LOT of.
2) Lots of juice from whatever I throw in.
3) Stainless steel and seems to be a sturdy product (I've had it only for 2 months so far.

Let's go over some things that could be improved.

1) Cleaning is a pain.  The steel mesh is quite difficult to get thoroughly clean and takes a good 10 minutes with the given scrubber to get clean.
2) Sometimes throwing in certain combinations of fruits and vegetables causes a bit of a mushy backlog which can slow down the feeding process.

For $900 it better be a darn good product.  I don't know if it is worth the full $900 but it definitely the best consumer juicer I know of (including the Norwalk, which I personally hate).

4.0,71.0,"I've owned the Super Angel for several months and having used it almost daily I can say that is is a quality juicer. It does an exceptionally good job juicing greens--something most juicers don't handle all that well. It is impressive how dry the pulp is after the juice is extracted.

The unit disassembles easily for cleaning. Cleaning the augers is very easy. Cleaning the portion that contains the screen is quite labor intensive. However, soaking it in a tub of vinegar helps considerably. I keep a plastic tub with a snap lock top full of vinegar. The vinegar doesn't seem to need to be replaced all that often and vinegar is inexpensive.

The plastic containers for collecting the juice and pulp are cheaply made plastic junk. One of mine has already developed a crack. Considering the cost of the juicer these shoddy accessories are inexcusable.

If you check out the manufacturer's website you'll see they charge very high prices for any replacement part you might need. Except for the plastic containers everything else is stainless steel and should last for a very long time.

If you plan to primarily juice fruits and carrots a less expensive juicer may suit you. However, if you are committed to juicing lots of greens for many years this juicer is great investment in your health and well being.",Excellent & Expensive,2014-02-23,7127,2269899,0,0.1878661527719497
5.0,87.0,"I did a fair amount of research before buying this unit.  It lived up to what was written:

1.  Sucks every bit of juice out of vegetables and fruits through super-efficient trituration.  Trituration basically means grinding, in this case with two heavy stainless gears.  Grinding saves the enzymes in the fruit and vegetables.  Cheaper models slice, which heats, kills and overly oxygenates them.  The SA spits out pulp which is so dry that it made my mouth very dry for a while the first, and last, time I tasted it.

2.  Can juice pretty much anything that is juiceable.  This includes the exotics, like wheatgrass, nuts etc.  No adjustments are necessary for different types of inputs.

3.  Easy to clean as juicers go.

4.  Doesn't take up a lot of space.

5.  Kind of cool looking.  The ultimate gadget to show off.

I don't know whether the less expensive twin-geared juicers that triturate can do the same.  I just know this unit does it great.  I also read that it's a lot easier to clean than the more expensive (more than 2X) Norwalk juicer.

If you've got a grand to spare, it's a good investment for your health and the health of your family.  It is very well built and will last a long time.  It won't be thrown away in a few years like a similarly or higher priced laptop.

Best of luck whatever you decide!

PS  The unit appears to be made in South Korea and it looks like they are disguising that fact by prominently labeling that it's from usjuicers.com and not putting the country of origin.  I am American.  I have no problem with the fact that the unit is made in South Korea.  I just wish they would label it as such.  I also wish South Korea made it as easy for Americans to sell products there as it is for South Koreans to sell products here.

Anyway, sorry for digressing.  If you are stuck on buying a top quality American made juicer, try the Norwalk model.

5.0,74.0,"I was reordering one of these because we lost the one I had and decided to write a review.

I shuck a lot of oysters.  My sister has the expensive Wusthof shucker that I've sometimes used, and I much prefer this one.  The blade on this one is a little more blunt than the Wusthof, yet the longer blade of the Trudeau seems to be more efficient in penetrating the shell (and probably less dangerous - more on that in a second).  What's more, the plastic sheath of the Trudeau is much easier on your hands than the metal sheath of the Wusthof.  I can usually get away without using gloves with the Trudeau using a steel sink as my ""backstop"", but with the Wusthof, gloves are damn near a necessity for both hands.  Oysters require a fair amount of force to open, and opening multiple oysters with the Wusthof without gloves gives me a bloody ring around my index finger and thumb from all the pressure against the edges of its metal sheath.  Also, its sharp blade has my fearing about a slip on the other hand.  I've never had an accident with it, but I'm sure it would just be a matter of time.  I'm faster with the Trudeau, the plastic sheath is hand friendly, I never have to worry about stitches from its blunt blade, and I usually never need to wear a glove - only occasionally on the receiving hand only to prevent minor scrapes from gripping the oysters.  I own a lot of great Wusthof knives, but do yourself and your wallet a favor and go with the Trudeau here.",Better than the Wusthof,2023-12-21,7471,2439244,1,0.7076085406719353

5.0,14.0,"I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price.  Well, I've had it for several months now and made many cups of coffee.  Don't be satisfied with the smaller one.  When the specs indicate ""cups"" they are VERY small cups.  This one, which is listed as ""6 cup"" is, in reality, 1 regular coffee cup size.  Just perfect for what I wanted.  I found I could speed the process of coffee making almost by the time it took me to make an instant cup of coffee.  I filled the pot with the very hot water from my Insta-hot on the sink.  It gets a little hot to handle when you have to screw the top part on, so I use a potholder for that.

What do I like about the coffee maker?
* It's classy looking. I finally put to rest the aluminum one that I was so tired of.
* Before I replaced it, my wife kept warning me that cooking with aluminum can increase your odds for Alzheimers.  It may not be true, but with my horribly poor memory, I wasn't about to take a chance.
* This turned out to be an unexpected and very welcomed plus.  Have you noticed how, when you pour coffee out of most pots, they drip.  This bugs me, but I've accepted that this is how pots are.  With the Liberta, it pours absolutely flawlessly.  Not a drip (or drop) after tilting the pot back up.
* It nice that the handle is metal.  It will never burn, crack, discolor, etc.  I never had any issue with it being to hot to handle as long as the flame under the pot was kept at low or medium heat, which is the sensible thing to do anyway.
* The gasket looked high quality, not the cheap rubber ones that crack with time.  In addition, included is an extra one.

What don't I like about the coffee maker?
* I always complain about the price, thinking somehow it could be cheaper.  Of course, it's probably me that's cheap.
* I don't like the little flat round insert used to decrease the volume of coffee.  It's too easy to get lost in my sink with dishes and also harder to bang the coffee into the garbage.  For smaller amounts of coffee, I just leave it out and don't really notice the difference in flavor.

5.0,17.0,"I bought this to replace a Bialetti stovetop maker I had for years. That one made decent coffee & was cheaper, but after a few years of use it started leaking water out of the bottom. I never dropped or dented it, so it appears to have just been thin and wore down so cracks developed after use.  I'd never heard of Cuisinox but decided to give it a try based on reviews of this and other pots. The design is cute CUTE!! More importantly, though I've only had it a little while, the pot seems much more solidly constructed (despite being made in China), like a larger Bialetti I own. In fact, I think it's even heavier. It does have a metal handle & top knob which get hot, but I found the black rubber handles on other machines did too, so hello pot holder! This also makes coffee super fast and so far it's been a really smooth tasting cup. Love it!

The level reducer (to make 3 instead of 6 cups) also makes this a versatile pot! Extra gasket is a bonus.","beautiful pot, tasty coffee",2015-08-01,9865,5314697,0,0.4992645687171978

I have to say it's very beautifully made. It looks like what shown in the picture. It's very solid and seems that it will last for a long time.

I also wanted to share that I experimented with it a little and learned that the espresso tastes a lot better if I mix in the milk or cream with the water in the bottom base and let the entire liquid mix steam through the coffee ground.

Another note is that no matter how low the level of heat you use to brew is, the entire thing gets pretty hot. If it were having a plastic handle it would have been burned away on my first use. I kind of expected this and am glad the whole thing is made of steel.

The flavor of soymilk I got from my first batch really has me excited to try more. I can't wait to experiment with all of the different recipes in the book that came with my machine. I am so happy that I can finally make milk that has no additives. 100% pure milk!

I would also like to point out that the milk tastes great right to the last drop. I actually drink if before it even has a chance to go bad. The milk I used to buy from the store would go bad before the expiry date and there is nothing more frustrating and awful tasting than sour soymilk (my stomach turns just thinking about it). This has really solved that problem for me. If I had known that great tasting soymilk was this easy to make, I would have jumped on the SoyQuick bandwagon a long time ago.

5.0,46.0,"So I haven't even had this thing for 24 hours and I love it! I jumped right into making a batch of soy milk.  Just so happens I like to keep a supply of soaked re-hydrated beans in the fridge ready for the next batch of milk. All you need to do is give them a good rinse, and toss them into the pitcher with the water.  Put the top on and push the button for soy milk. (it has 3 count them 3 settings,for Soy, Grains, and Mung beans) 15 minutes later I had soy milk. I just poured the milk through a hand strainer (which comes with the maker) and the milk was done.  First thing I noticed is the color and texture of the soy milk was really milky.  I love the milk that my SDZ5 made, but WOW! Silk Soy eat your heart out.  Add some chopped dates and even more WOW!  Well I'm going to be making soy milk more often.  Like almost every night now compared to 2 or 3 times a week.  I really want to try the Soy Latte.  Just add some coffee beans to the mix it says.  Well I'm all for trying that.  Think I'll do that tomorrow morning for my coffee. Oh and also on my list of to try is making some milk from oats.
  Oh, did I mention that this machine is filterless.  Really nice, makes for a faster easier clean up.  The top starts out looking the same but it has a blender guard that has big holes in it and no bottom.  The guard just slips right off everything scrubs up really easy and fast.  It was all cleaned up in a matter of minutes.  No filter to scrub and make sure it was cleaned good.  Just run the milk through the hand strainer that's provided with the machine.  You don't even have to worry about another pitcher or container to strain the milk into.  It comes with that too!  Did I mention that I'm loving this machine.

I love the new SoyQuick 930P!  The new design eliminates the need for scrubbing a filter, which makes clean-up fast and easy (and I make 2 batches 2 or 3 times a week).  The machine is quieter than former SoyQuick models, and, best of all, the new model allows you to use more soybeans than the older models do, so that you can make thicker, creamier soy milk with absolutely no scorching!  You can also combine soybeans with grains-- I add some oats for a silky soy milk. The process is so easy now that I will also be making tofu more frequently than I used to.

If you are allergic to soy, the manual is full of recipes for milks using other types of beans, grains, seeds and nuts.

The company is very customer-friendly and responsive to customer's needs, and the 7-year warranty is great!

I love all the new features. Like the filterless technology; there is no filter cup, I just toss the beans in with the water, put the machine head on, and press start. The transfer jug is really practical with a wire mesh strainer that fits right on top. I just pour the hot soymilk through the strainer into the jug, the pulp stays in the strainer, and so the milk is silky-smooth.  I empty the strainer, then flavor and cool the milk in the jug, with the strainer in place. Perfect!

The neat thing for me is that, since I have this new model, I make delicious, firm tofu all the time--several times a week. I cannot remember the last time I bought a block of tofu. The transfer jug and strainer assembly make homemade tofu a simple matter and the cleanup is a snap.

5.0,4.0,"It would be an exaggeration to say that this machine changed my life. It would not, however, be an exaggeration to say that this machine has greatly improved the quality of my life. About a year ago I finally decided to lose weight, and on my doctor's recommendation I started replacing my breakfast meal with a Metagenics health shake. He told me to forget about cow milk and use soy, rice or nut milk. The good news is that I lost 30 pounds. The bad news is that I was spending a fortune on store-bought  soy, rice, and almond milk. I had heard that many milk machines were difficult to clean, that they boiled over, and were just a pain in general to use. I do research for a living, so I used my professional skills when choosing this product. And I have not been disappointed.
Simple to use, easy to clean, and very handsome in the kitchen, this machine is a joy. Every household should have one, quite honestly! In about 15 minutes you will have amazing tasting soy milk, grain milk or nut milk. The sky is your limit. My favorite is coffee flavored soy milk. Two little scoops of soy beans and about 1/3 cup of coffee beans will yield two liters of a beverage that will blow you away. And it costs just pennies to make. Another heavenly beverage that I regularly make is brown jasmine rice milk. Very delicious. And the tofu! I have always enjoyed cooking stir fried tofu with vegetables, Korean tofu stew etc., but the taste of homemade tofu is, well, simply outstanding. There is a certain metallic taste to store-bought tofu. The tofu that this machine produces is rich, pure, nutty, and downright delicious. Also, I enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning. Oddly, Silk brand  soy milk separates into weird curds when I pour it in my coffee. Homemade soy milk does not.
Okay, on the downside? Yes, making almond milk is a bit of a pain. You need to blanch the almonds and soak them for twenty-four hours. Also, because the machine is not huge it only makes a small block of tofu, about half the size of a store-bought block. But these are really minor complaints. Once you taste homemade soy milk, almond milk, homemade tofu, you will wonder why you ever bought them at the market. And if you buy two tofu molds from the company (or use your own) that solves the tofu problem.
I have contacted the company twice with questions. Both times that got back to me within one or two hours. Their customer service is, in my experience, unparalleled. Everyone that I have dealt with there is utterly charming and completely knowlegdeable about the machine. They actually WANT you to contact them and discuss the machine, recipes, etc.
Compared to other machines, this one costs just a little bit more. Don't let this prevent you from buying it. You are paying for quality.

5.0,18.0,"I read through many online articles, reviews, and discussion forums and was convinced that the SoyaPower Plus is the right choice for me. I was ready to buy it directly from [...] when I found that it was listed at Amazon for a lower price.  Average Person's review confirmed most of the ""Positives"" that I had read from other websites.

I have used the machine about a dozen times by now. It makes great soymilk! I really like the milks made with soybean and rice or oats. I followed the instruction on the user manual - use 3/4 cup of dry soybean and 1/4 cup of rice, soaked overnight; add water, drop the soaked soybean and rice into the machine pitcher, plug in the power, and press the ""Soy + "" button. It is that simple! I have tried three of the five recipes on the user manual, and got great soy milk every time!

The cleanup is fast and easy! That is the important thing to me because many reviews of other machines complained about difficulty of cleaning. So this is the big PLUS!

The plastic liner on the stainless pitcher does reduce the noise. The machine makes much less noise than a typical blender. The plastic cover is still warm to the touch but not hot enough to hurt. I can image that without the plastic liner, the stainless steel pitcher would be very hot with boiling soymilk inside.

I can confirm most of the positives ""average person"" listed in his review: filter-less for easy cleaning, the four functional settings for making different type of milks, the insulation liner for heat and noise reduction, the head and body clamps for safety, the foldable handle, and the preheating non-beany feature.

As for the Cons, I don't see many. The off-white color looks better to me than the white color. The fit of the plastics was the one I was most concerned after reading the reviews, but it is actually much better than I expected. I don't see any gaps on the machine head. There is a seam between the plastic outliner pieces, but that is no issue to me because I don't see what it can go wrong with it. I don't expect the finish of a Japanese piano anyway! The stainless pitcher with plastic outliner feels very sturdy and strong.

Overall, I am very happy with it. It is so simple to use, almost foolproof! I give it a five star!!",The SoyaPower Plus is a great soy milk maker!,2023-06-16,11343,5732091,1,0.6062026183270113
3.0,28.0,"Thank you for the ""Average Person"" review. It pretty well matches my experience with the unit I have. I was wondering whether to get the OTHER HIGHLY RATED filterless soymilk maker - and I'm still not sure. I searched all over the internet for something made in Japan - because it would be made better, and because the Humane Society showed a video of the Chinese killing cats and dogs to sell their fur around January 1, 2009, the day Britain outlawed fur from China. (In case you thought it was my imagination, Britain has never yet made a law based on my imagination.)

Soy milk makers are ALL made in China - even though other countries also use them. I expected mine to be beige, or tan, whatever you call it, not white, and that color is fine with me.

I like having my own soy milk that is not like the store stuff. Do any men drink that nasty store stuff? I think only clueless broads get online to ask how they can make their homemade soy milk taste like the mixture of eggnog, white paint, thickeners, syrups, and nasty goop they love to drink from the store. Calling it ""creamy"" doesn't make it any less nasty. (Although this review is filled with useful information, I expect the ones who love ""creamy"" glop will say that it wasn't useful out of spite. Such is life.) I paid big bucks for a machine to get away from that stuff! Cow milk isn't goopy and sweet!

Besides, the stores carry a huge shelf of nasty thick syrupy eggnog goo, and maybe three boxes of soy milk made from - get this - SOYBEANS and WATER. (How novel! What next? Go Figure!) And the soybeans/water soy milk doesn't come in several variations such as low-fat, and it never goes on sale.

My soy milk smelled like it had been through someone - like ""eggs"", but stronger. Once it off-gassed, it still tasted alright. This was both the Laura beans and organic beans from a store. I changed to beans from another store, and it smells pretty good and tastes even better. Try other beans, and leave the soy milk container open until it has completely cooled.

It could use a better-fitting head. The head is the new part; the pitcher is obviously left over from Soyajoy days, but could use a small change. It could use an off switch. It could use better quality accessories, especially the mystery-plastic cheapie pitcher. It could use better instructions on what button is optimal for combinations of beans and grain. The recipes copied from a website say ""process according to your machine instructions"" - which are sparse. I am amazed that a reputable (as far as I know) American company ordering them can't get a decent translation. They could update their old Soyajoy instructions.

So I'm not glowing with satisfaction at the machine quality, and I do think that a machine could be made that would give me that satisfaction. However, it does make good soy milk that has the consistency and unsweetened flavor of cow milk, with a light, pleasant aroma. (If you follow the above precautions.) It cleans up very easily. It is fairly quiet, cool to the touch, and fast. The complaints of a hard-to-clean filter are not a problem for the steel blade cover, or for the heating elements if you cool them with a small amount of cold water.

I like my machine fairly well; I like my homemade soy milk on cereal a lot -- no thick eggnoggy nasty syrupy goop! -- and I have wondered about buying that other soy milk maker. If Zojirushi or another Japanese company ever wises up and makes a filterless soy milk maker - using the improvements of existing machines of course - I'll be all over it. The main improvements could be a better quality decanting pitcher, an on/off switch, better recipes, and a better fit and latching machinery on the head.

If you like eating and drinking syrup-sweetened Elmer's glue, save your money and don't buy a soy milk maker. The stores already pander to your taste, anyway. If you like unsweetened, lightly flavored soy milk with the consistency of milk, this machine makes it pretty well, and you will like the result better than the store-bought boxed stuff - minus the trips to the store and the waste boxes.

**Two-year update: (Dontcha hate reviewers who tell you a product is great when they've had it for 6 days?) I have used this soymilk maker for 2 years now. Everything I wrote still stands. I would like to have been able to afford to buy two different ones and compare, but my guess is that it is the quietest machine.  It is still a good machine. It still could be made better. Now when I pour the liquid out, it dribbles down the outside, likely because the plastic outer case is not bonded tightly to the stainless steel container. I still use it at least once a week.

** 2-1/2 year update: I still use it, but am making more nut milks with a blender; no heat required. Nuts don't have that slight rotten soybean smell. I still spend much time and pay extra money to buy things made in the USA when possible. ABC News has had TWO weeklong specials called ""Made in America"", also available online. They did not mention the Chinese killing cats and dogs to sell their fur, but the UK outlawed buying fur from China on New Year's Day 2009. (Or 2008?) The UK is ahead; the US is behind and lagging further behind in being progressive. The video of the slaughter of cats and dogs in China is probably still available through the Humane Society website.

** 2-3/4 year update: It is seeing infrequent use now, though it is still holding up well. I have found several foods with which to make a ""milk"" that is not like the viscous over-sweetened store-bought eggnoggy glop that all the broads mistakenly call ""creamy"".  This machine makes a superior alternative to the seaweed (carageenan)-thickened, flour-clotted, sugar-sweetened latex paint substitute the stores are happy to sell to you and the broads who love that dreck. So does a regular old blender, when you use nuts instead of soybeans. Both are good.

** After several months of making nut milks only, no soy milk, I ran the machine on some soybeans I'd had around a while. The operation seemed intuitively obvious to me, so I never gave a thought to giving more pointers. I soaked the beans most of the day, about 9 to 6, in the refrigerator. I rinsed the soaking water off extremely well. (Twice, only because I happened to be in the kitchen in the middle of soaking.) I use filtered water and some sea salt. I hold the head heating element under a small stream of cold water immediately to cool it, and fill the pitcher with cool water, then use a dish brush or sponge with baking soda. You don't need detergent.

It finished with a wonderful aroma that was a delight to savor. No egg smell. If it were winter, I would have mixed some cocoa into a cup of it right then. I strained once into a metal pan, which cools much faster than a Pyrex (Made in USA!) pitcher. I strained again when cool into a plastic pitcher, and left the lid off in the refrigerator overnight.

4.0,307.0,"There are very few reviews of this machine online, probably because it is so new, and there are many reviews of it's main competitor (the OTHER filterless soy milk maker!)

I've made soy milk by hand before, it's tiring and requires your attention at all times to prevent boilovers. This machine make it extremely easy. Soak the beans for a few hours, then put them in the machine with water and press the button..Voila!

What you get:
- Pitcher, this is where it is cooked, it has a non-removable plastic covering that dampens sound and insulates the heat.
- Head unit, this has the blending blades, the heating element and the electronics. It clamps down to the pitcher
- A plastic pitcher, this is where you would pour the soymilk from the cooking pitcher into to filter it
- A sieve/filter with a handle. You put this over your plastic pitcher and then pour the soy milk form the cooking pitcher into it to filer out the ""Okara"" (soy pulp). Sort of cheap, but it does the job. I suggest you invest in a $5 ""gold coffee filter"" that is used instead of paper coffee filters in coffee machines, the fine mesh of the coffee filter really gets out the tiny soy particles!
- A cleaning pad and a little brush. For cleaning, though you can just wipe it with a dishcloth.
- A recipe book. This actually looks more like a print out of a web page where people posted their recipes. In fact...I've seen the web page that this was printed from!
- Instructions. Bad English, but it's a simple machine and the instructions are clear enough.
- Power cord. This attaches to the head unit much like a computer power cable.
- A sample of ""Laura"" Soy Beans. I ordered like 20 lbs of these special Laura beans online...for about the same price that I can get soybeans from the local ""Whole Foods"" store. I didn't notice any difference at all, though the Laura Beans (I think they all come from one farm) are non GMO (not Genetically Modified Organisms), as I'm sure the Whole Foods bulk beans are, but don't specifically say. They give you enough beans to make two batches of soy milk.

The pro:
- It makes soymilk as advertised as well as giving options to make other drinks. There are 4 settings. The soymilk is as good as you'll get from any machine.

- Cleanup is fast and easy. Many people complain about the machines that use filters as the filter is hard to clean. This machine is basically a blender with heat. Once the drink is made, you unclip the head unit, run some cool water on it and brush/wipe it down. Pretty easy!

- The pitcher is somewhat insulated for heat and sound. The soymilk is HOT when it comes out, but the pitcher is covered with an insulating plastic covering so it won't burn you if you touch it. Also the sounds is muffled a bit so you can use it at night withough your kids waking up! The sound is less volume than a blender and lower frequency too so it's more of a rumble than a blending sound.

- The head unit clamps to the pitcher, so that helps with sound and probably helps with accidentally knocking the head off the pitcher.

- Handle on the head unit is sturdy and locks in the upward position, or folds down. This is very useful when cleaning. You can hold the head by the handle and run the dirty parts under water. When you put it away, you can just fold it down. I would not try and carry the unit full of water/soymilk by the handle though, use the side pitcher handle!

- It heats the water/beans BEFORE it starts grinding. This is a huge plus because apparently if you grind cold beans it will result in very ""beany"" tasting soymilk. Making soymilk by hand and grinding with hot water and then filtering is not pleasant...this machine does it for you!
Some cheaper machines may just grind the beans first and then heat the ground beans/water.

- It's filterless. This means you dump the beans and water into the main pitcher. You don't have to load up a little filter basket! This means you can add more beans if you like without being limited by the filter capacity. The cleanup is super easy too, though the step of filtering is done outside the machine when you pour the soy milk in the cooking pitcher though the supplied sieve into the supplied plastic pitcher.

Cons:
- The fit of the plastic is not exacly great. There were some gaps in some of the pieces, not what I'd expect for the price I paid. This does not affect the performance of the machine AT ALL, but I'm being honest here so I have to point this out.

- Mine was NOT WHITE, it was an off white colour, like the colour that white plastic gets if you set it in the sun for 5 years, that sort of yellowed colour. Sort of like an old APPLE II computer. This is not really a con, but be warned that the picture is not like what you will get, unless the distrubuter would like to comment on this.

- The pitcher on mine says Soya Power, and the head unit says ""Soyapower Plus"" so obviously they just put the new head units with whatever pitchers they have. Not a serious con, but weird.

- It ships from the distributer IN THE PRODUCT BOX, there is no enclosing shipping box. Mine came pretty banged up, which is the fault of the shipping company BUT it was not protected from such damage. I was happy to see the unit itself was not damaged, but it very well could have been since the box had holes in it and many dents. This is my biggest beef, though other reviews I've read have praised this as a feature as it uses less resources. This is true, and the unit is packed fairly well in the box, but it was a close call that nothing fell out of my damaged box.

Neither Pro nor Con:
- It has no on/off switch. You plug the power cable into the head unit then press one of the cycle buttons to start. When the cycle is done, it beeps until you unplug it! You will want to detach the power cable from the head anyway when you go to clean the head.

OK, so why did I choose this machine over the other HIGHLY RATED other brand ""PREMIER"" machine? Becuase it is insulated for sound and heat. I have twin babies that go to sleep around 8pm and the only time I have to make the soy milk (one of the kids has milk allergies, hence the need for lots of soymilk!) is after they go to bed. So I when I was making it by hand (to supplement the store bought stuff which was way too sweet or way too bland) I used a blender, but it was loud, plus since I had to filter the bean mash by hand, I didn't like to blend with hot water, for fear of breaking the blender's pitcher and because holding burning hot bean mash is not fun when you're trying to squeeze it. And as I mentioned, if you don't grind the beans in hot water, you get a lot of beany taste. (some mumbo jumbo about enzymes or something...look it up).

I was happy that the sound was a medium volume low rumble instead of the high pitched grinding sound from the blender. Also the plastic surrounding the steel cooking pitcher made it less perilous to touch.

The milk you get is the same taste/feel as any HOME MADE SOY MILK. It is NOT LIKE STORE BOUGHT! Though I'm trying some recipes I found online to make it a bit thicker. I noticed that the soymilk has a slight egg smell, which I like, but my wife hates. It's not intense, sort of like egg custard might smell like. Weird!

All in all, I think this is an excellent product. I wish mine were white instead of 1982 Apple II coloured, and I wish that the plastic trim was a bit better fitting, but these are minor details as the machine makes soymilk like it's supposed to and it is VERY EASY and the cleanup is almost trivial, unlike filter basket machines. I look forward to making other types of ""milk"" in it!

It would have five stars if it had more refined fit and finish, worthy of the price paid.

4.0,0.0,"I've owned the Soy Power Plus for 3 and a half years now! I can't say I'm an expert user, since I only make soy milk. We heard a friend made soy milk at home and being weekly purchasers of store soy milk abroad and not wanting the overly sweet soy milk here, we decided to invest in a soy milk maker at home.

The most important thing to know is that this does make delicious soy milk, although it tastes a little less 'beany' than soy milk we're used to from Japan/China/Taiwan. I prefer it a little more beany, but this soy milk is still delicious. We tried drinking it sweetened at first, but after a while we began to prefer it unsweetened. The soy milk lasts about a week in the refrigerator.

Also, if you are ambitious the soy pulp remaining from making soy milk can be used for foods. The easiest recipe we have come up with is making okara cookies from this pulp, which have become way preferred over traditional over-sweet chocolate chip cookies.  We've also added it to bread and biscotti which softens the bread and makes it taste more like soy.

CONS:

After 3 years of making about two batches a week, the latch is starting to come loose, and the inner u-shaped heating component is coming loose. However, I think 3.5 years of regular use is a great value and I imagine I could easily get at least another 1.5 years of use out of this.

Cleaning can be a real chore. I never found the brush or pad that comes with this for cleaning really useful. I would recommend that immediately after use, you clean this right away while it's still hot! The 'okara' or soy pulp will come off easily at this point. If you wait too long you risk a long night of scrubbing at the sink. Also the top cover with the handle contains electronics, so you also cannot just run water over the top.","Makes great soy milk, but can be tough to clean",2019-11-28,11343,3294427,0,0.4515276497362087

5.0,5.0,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a world class chef and I don't usually spend a lot of time learning to cook. However it is a passion I am starving to sink my teeth into. I love to cook meats and vegies and often times end up doing them at the same time. I usually grill as much as possible except when the weather is awful, then I like to come in and use my mediocre pots and pans I picked up at bed bath and beyond. Well I think I will be cooking indoors from now on as I have recently picked up this pan and discovered how easy it is and sturdy it is compared to the other pans I own.
 I was a believer in non-stick black coating, but after a little while that coating comes off and the pan looks ridiculous. Well I must say I have cooked some mighty delicious meals in my time and had to let the pots soak so I could get all the nastiness off. Well not any more. This stainless pot has opened new doors, EG new foods that I can cook and new recipes to try because all I have to do is throw this bad boy in the dishwasher when I'm done and not worry about soaking or scrubbing. That alone is what has sold me on it.
When I ordered this pan I assumed like all my other AMAZON orders that it would take a few days to process and a few days shipping. So you can imagine my surprise when the same day that I placed my order I got the email advising me my product had shipped along with a tracking number. 3 days later I opened the most protective packaging I have ever seen and took out my new shinny pan. I right away decided I would cook some shrimp for dinner and got to work. I placed butter in the pan and placed it on my electric top stove. The butter melted very quickly and did not burn, then I added a little lemon juice, some white wine and began to steam my shrimp. They came out fantastic. I left the pan on the stove top and left it. I came back to a greasy mess. So I put the pan whole right into the dishwasher and let it run. When it was done out came a sparkling clean pan, like I had never used it. I then decided the next night to cook some steak with soy sauce and Worchester sauce. I had some stainless steel pots in the past that stained, and never went back to normal. So I was a little skeptical about trying it again, But when the meal was over I put the pan in the dishwasher, ran it with a ton of other stuff and wouldn't you know it came out perfectly.
My experience with this pan, and with the company as a whole has been amazing. I recently moved into my house and as most people do I was frugal while buying utensils and cooking devices. Recently we had started to transition our kitchen from Walmart worthy crap, to high end royalty items.

This will be my second set of pans that I have owned and I don't think I will own another brand other than the USA Pans and here are a few reasons why I feel this way.

Each pan has its size marked on one of the sides. It is important to cook with the right size pan and now I don't have to guess.  As I took the wrappers off I noticed how shinny the pans were. I could see myself in them as if they were mirrors, they are beautiful.  As I was cooking with the 4 quart pot I noticed that I did not have to use as high of a heat to get the water to boil due to the 5-ply distribution feature. That way I can save energy while I cook.

I got this to use on an induction cooktop, and it works great.  It heats up quickly, but not as quick as my cast iron pan (duh).

5.0,0.0,"I recently purchased the 13 inch skillet and have been using it on a regular basis for about the past month.  I will say that it took a little time to get used to cooking with this pan as I have always used teflon type non-stick.  However, after I got used to pre-heating the pan and then pre-heating the oil I'm going to cook with I will say the results have been truly impressive.  When used correctly food cooks very evenly and definitely turns out better than it ever did with my old pan.  The heat required is much lower and I find clean up to be a non-event.  In most cases I allow the pan to soak over night in water and then in the morning the pan cleans ups with just a sponge.  I haven't used any polisher yet on the pan and there are a few slight scratches and slight discoloration, but it doesn't bother me in the least and considering how much we use the pan it is wearing extremely well.  We are sold on stainless steel cookware and I am really impressed with the quality of USA Pan for the price.  This isn't the most inexpensive cookware out there but I think the value is incredibly high.  I plan to invest in the the 8-piece set in the future.

4.0,46.0,"For grinding spices this unit increased my production rate dramatically.  It is very well made of quality materials. Very simple to use and required no pre-processing.

The Waring Commercial Spice Grinder
Within 30 minutes I completely ground 3 quarts of dehydrated spices (saving me 8 hours).  This unit ""grinds"" using a high speed blending action that pulverizes the spice.  Best reults are achieved using smaller quantities in the bowl, but the unit works so fast it wasn't a problem. Consistency varies with processing time from coarse to a very fine powder. Operation is simple no adjustments to make except how long you hold the button.  I was amazed at how quiet the unit is during operation, easy to converse with others during use.

Dust Control
Each grinding bowl has its own knives and locks in place on the base. A clear cover, with the pulse button is then placed over the bowl, a portion of the cover is designed to prevent dust from escaping from the process.

Waring makes only one model of their commercial spice grinder(wSG30).  It lists for $250.00 retail, but is available for much less on the internet as low as $126.00.  (As of this writing Amazon is selling the unit for $197.00) Due to this I purchased the unit from a local resturaunt supply store.  Waring is not releasing this product to normal department stores (reason unknown).

Manual vs. the WSG30 (Waring Commercial Spice Grinder)
The manual ""Back to Basics"" grinder took nearly 3 hours to grind a batch of spices (approximately 1 quart) which required an extra pre-processing step to ensure the dehydrated spices were small enough to fit into the grinder.

It is wasted energy if the food is finished earlier than I have set the timer for and I don't want to have to unplug it every single time to stop the heating element from working (as the timer will still go on until finished even if unplugged and no, you can't just turn the timer backwards to 0 it won't let you) and a pain in the neck to have to keep setting the timer if I'm not sure of the timing, wait for it to heat up and...  Otherwise, it is a sturdy unit and I suppose it does what it is meant to do.  And considering the timer is independent of the unit as far as how it works, I suppose one could use the timer for something else as well but that's not why I bought it, I bought it to make things easier, not more difficult as the outlet in my kitchen where I would plug this in is a bit difficult to reach.

I wanted something that was professional grade, somewhat idiot proof with the ability to completely manual if I was in the mood. It pulls perfectly every time if you get the grind and the tamp right.

The double boiler is critical if you want to froth simultaneously. The aesthetics are there. It's fast, pretty and very reasonably priced for what it is. Ive been using it for a couple months now and have no complaints  - I would buy it again.

I also recommend the Breville Smart Grinder. I've bought it for others as well (who also rave about it) and use it a lot for both espresso and drip. Breville is doing a pretty awesome job these days.",It's pretty much perfect.,2017-04-11,21174,4691213,0,0.0987135322267854
5.0,42.0,"My heart was set on a Rocket. I decided to try the Breville even though it didn't have the E61 group head nor the proven track record of quality. The group head is controlled by an element rather than the Rocket's mechanical E61 approach. I shy away from Breville because their products aren't great quality, but this machine is very well thought out:

Pros:
the drip tray tells you when it's time to empty so you don't accidentally overflow it; the tamp stores nicely with a magnetic insert; the choice between manual and the automatic volume buttons make pulling the shot easy; the PID temperature control on the group head lets me choose brew temp almost on the fly; the pressure gauge helps me adjust my grind and tamp; the lever action steam wand is much easier to use than a round knob; there is a wheel that drops down beneath the drip tray to make it easy to maneuver the machine on the counter; the water tank will overflow into the drip tray if you overfill; you can pour water from the boiler with the left knob (no lever, though not needed) for Americanos; you can program the machine to turn on at a specified time in the morning; you can pop up the lid in the front if you want to fill the water tank from the front rather than always needing to turn the machine to access the tank; the steel casing is easy to clean (though it shows finger prints); it is stable enough that the machine doesn't turn when you twist the portafilter in; the dual boiler for the steam wand makes milk frothing easy and quick; overall spacing and placement of controls works well; heats up fast, I can pull as many shots as I want with this machine, it can easily handle your dinner guests.

Cons:
It's not as pretty as the Rockets and some other machines; Brushed steel housing shows finger prints; 57mm [58mm: correction by Greg in comments] portafilter (no naked filter available yet); tamp is plastic and metal (though it works fine); Breville's poor quality history [Greg in the comments said he's been happy with Breville quality]; requires service every 4-5 years because you can't back flush [can't descale: correction by Greg in comments] it yourself (though, it's dual boiler rather than heat exchange so you have the option to use distilled water so you can cut down on mineral deposits); Noisy vibration pump (though, rotaries are a huge price increase); Did I mention it's Breville?

Grinder Requirements:
The machine requires a good grinder to get the most out of it. I have a step-less Mazzer Mini (apprx $500). Because of grinder quality I am able to dial in my shots to the exact extraction time. If you used a lower quality grinder you might have a hard time getting grind just right. The only reason I mention these grinders and their prices is to reinforce the fact that espresso machines are limited by grind quality. Uneven grinds are no problem with drip coffee but it will cause variations in espresso quality.

Summary:
I've decided to keep this machine rather than getting the Rocket. It saved me $1000 and I don't expect to keep it longer than 5 years. In addition, the automatic and manual shot buttons are convenient. With a Rocket you only have manual. Another con on the Rocket is that it you need to use a power cord timer if you want to start it at a certain time in the morning so it has a chance to heat up. The built in Breville timer takes care of that for you.

This Breville vs the Rancilio Silvia:
Would I personally recommend spending an extra $500 to get this machine rather than a Rancilio Silvia? Yes. This machine is larger than the Silvia, but it has a built in PID and pressure gauge. To get a PID installed on a Silvia will cost a minimum of $250 and you still won't have the pressure gauge or any of the automation features. The extra $500 in this case is worth every penny (provided the Breville PID works, of course).

=== Update 1/5/12 ===

According to Seattle Coffee Gear, Breville will be offering a bottomless portafilter for this machine in early 2012. Keep watch!

=== Update 3/20/12 ===

1) Purchased naked portafilter from Breville. Great learning tool. And it's messy when you mess up your shot preparation. Of course, that reinforces the learning experience.

2) Took a 2hr espresso class with Cole McBride at Visions Espresso in Seattle today. Learned I've been sloppy about dosing my shots and that it actually matters. Now I weigh my shots to help me correct grinder adjustment and consistency. I also learned to avoid some bad habits. If you live in an area where you can take a class I think it's definitely worth it. If you're in and around Seattle call Cole at Visions to get his class schedule.",Excellent Value: Capable of Perfect Espresso and Easy to use,2023-04-01,21174,525932,1,0.5656198670542131
5.0,4.0,"Wow! Very impressed! Before when you heard Breville and espresso machine in the same sentance you would run in the other direction. No offense to Breville, the prior machines look amazing, unfortunently they have cheap thermoblocks inside of them with no way to regulate temperature or pressure.

That's all changed with the dual boiler...no thermoblocks here, just two fully independent stainless steel boilers, PID controlled group head and brew boiler, OPV, and more. A feature set unheard of in the ~$1k price range.

My ONLY ""issue"" with the machine was the non-calibrated OPV. Like many others have reported, the OPV was not set correctly on some of the early machines and brew pressure was pegging the gauge at 13. It's an easy enough fix, just 4 screws and some tinkering.

OPV adjusted and I'm pulling PERFECT ~30 second shots. So good I can't tell the difference between shots from a $10k Famea E61 Legend at my local coffee bar.

If you're used to the steam power from massive 2+ liter machines, you may find the Breville too slow in the steam department. It takes me about a minute and a half to steam 12oz of milk (video on YouTube). Although since it's a double boiler, you can brew while steaming.  When you get your programmed buttons dialed in, you can start brewing when the milk is around 100* and you'll have a perfect latte in under 2 minutes.",Breville actually pulled it off!,2023-08-30,21174,5566368,1,0.5537508648525682
2.0,15.0,"I used this machine 2-3x/day and have gone through 3 in the past few years.  The first 2 were replaced with an upgraded version easily by Breville since this machine was relatively new to the market and they admited still had bugs to work out.  This week the pressure head to the wand cracked and the warranty does not extend, even when a unit is replaced, so now I'm stuck with a $400 repair bill.  When working I love this machine, but Breville hasn't gotten them down yet and don't plan to sink any more money into it.
I use only filtered water, replace the filter monthly, de-scale and clean when the alert pops up, not sure what could have prevented this other than better quality machine.",Years Later,2017-02-26,21174,3958294,0,0.3066939470195755
5.0,133.0,"Well, quite a bit judging from the latest espresso effort from Breville. Since I love espresso, this is going to be a lengthy review. My apologies.

If you would rather not read all my ramblings, the bottom line is this is a great consumer-level machine with some ""prosumer"" features. It is very user friendly and has an abundance of well thought-out convenience touches. My concerns are that it has to be professionally serviced every 4-5 years and that it lacks a proven track record regarding reliability. I think it's a good match for someone who wants a feature-rich machine that offers ease-of-use automation, but also the ability to take a hands-on approach should one desire. The brand name won't impress the ""serious"" espresso crowd, but it hits the mark where it counts - tasty espresso.

Full review:
Breville is one of my favorite small appliance companies since they spend a lot of time on the little things that make a difference when using their products. However, when it comes to espresso, I've not been satisfied with their products (I've tried their die-cast espresso machine and the Modena). Decent looks, decent price, but mediocre performance.

Their so-so past espresso efforts, plus the fact that they are a general kitchen appliance maker, never earned Breville much love among the ""serious"" espresso crowd. Their view is: want a juicer or toaster oven? Go for a Breville. Want an espresso machine? Go for one made in Italy.

Breville has made a big effort to change that perception with this machine. It is packed with features seen on prosumer-level machines: a PID (which allows precise temperature control), a heated group head, the ability to tweak a wide range of settings, and even a timer for start-up and shut-down. For me it's the best of both worlds - I can play with the settings when I feel so inclined, or just push a button when I want an espresso RIGHT NOW.

A big change from past models is the dual boiler setup. This means there is one boiler dedicated to brewing, and another dedicated for steaming milk. The benefits include the ability to steam and brew at the same time, faster recovery time, and more consistent temperature. According to Breville, the water comes into the steam boiler first, then goes to the brew boiler so you don't get a big influx of cold water that drops the temperature.

Other nice features include an automated cleaning cycle (more on that later) and a hot water dispenser. Little helpful touches abound, such as a cubby behind the drip tray to hold cleaning supplies and a wheel that pops up to help move the machine when you need to get to the back of the unit. It's indicative of the thought that Breville puts into their designs - clearly the people who design these products actually use them as well.

The overall design is similar to many of their other appliances. It looks like a Breville, with lit buttons and nicely shaped stainless throughout. Plastic, when used, looks and feels high quality. Very sleek looking, but to my eye it lacks the beauty of the high-end Italian machines. I'd say it's ""handsome"" rather than ""gorgeous.""

I paired this initially with a Breville Smart Grinder, but was not pleased with the results. I couldn't get the grind fine enough (I'm using the non-pressurized basket). It's important to note that I have NOT modified my grinder with the shims. If you get the shim kit (free from Breville) their Smart Grinder should be an OK choice. I had much better results with a Baratza Vario grinder. Remember, a great espresso starts with the grinder - don't bother spending good money on a machine unless you also budget for a good grinder.

After only a few failed experiments I was turning out very nice shots. Granted, you can get great shots from a much less expensive machine, but the Breville saves you from having to temperature surf or worry about other such variables. All you have to do is concentrate on the grind, dose and tamp.

My only quibble regarding shots was that occasionally the puck stuck to the shower screen. It's easy to dislodge (gently nudge it with your finger and it pops off) but was irritating. Nice dry puck.

The tamper included with the machine is OK. It has a standard 58mm portafilter so a third-party tamper is easy to get (my Rattleware 58mm worked great).

Steaming prowess seems quite good. I can't give you a detailed description of how a latte tastes since the idea of adding milk to espresso makes me cringe. But I had no problems foaming milk, and the results were judged excellent by friends who are willing to drink what I term milk-tainted espresso. The fact that I had no problems foaming milk speaks highly of how easy this machine is to use, since I lack much time using a steam wand. The steam control knob is graduated so you can easily change the steam volume; there is a nice plastic grip on the wand to prevent burned fingers; the wand has a ball joint for flexibility; and the steam itself is very dry. It does not have a double-insulated wand, so you have to make sure you clean it well after use or the milk bakes on (found that out the hard way).

The tanks are stainless steel. Any respectable espresso geek would sneer at that since copper or brass are preferred for holding uniform temperatures. But with the PID control and an heated group head, temperature fluctuations are nil. I don't see the tank material to be an issue at all.

The machine comes with  4 baskets (single and double in both pressurized and non-pressurized) plus a whole host of goodies including a frothing jug (and a rather nice one at that) and the cleaning supplies. The manual is clear, easy to understand, and a provides a great deal of helpful information to step you through the program options.

Now the bad parts. Let's start with cleaning. On the plus side, it offers an automated backflush system that is easy as pie to use - basically just push a button. It comes with a rubber insert to create a blind portafilter and 2 cleaning tablets. It will prompt you to run a cleaning cycle after roughly 200 shots, but you can also run it on-demand.

They also include enough water filters for one year (2 month replacement cycle). Filters cost $30 for a 6-pack at the Breville site (could not find them yet on Amazon). The other regular replacement item would be the group head gasket, as in all espresso machines. It is not yet available on the Breville site.

What concerns me is that you cannot - repeat CANNOT - descale this machine yourself. They state it has to be professionally descaled. The following quote is from the support section on the Breville website:

""To ensure a long life of optimal brewing and steaming performance, it is important the machine is serviced by an authorized Breville service agent when the `SERVICE' prompt scrolls across the LCD screen. The `SERVICE' prompt will appear after 6,000 cycles - approximately 4-5 years of regular use in a domestic environment. The frequency of this prompt will depend on your frequency of use.""

I emailed Breville to find out the cost of the service and was told it would run $60 to $100. There are only a few service centers, however, and none anywhere near me. So that means boxing it up and shipping, which will add to the cost and trouble.

I don't care for that at all. I don't have confidence that the filters will reduce the scale to the point where it doesn't need to be removed for 3-4 years. Scale is an unavoidable issue in any machine that heats water. Having to pack up the machine and send it in for a ""professional"" descaling is going to be really irksome not only in terms of cost, but also in terms of potential shipping damage.

That's a big issue that you need to be willing to deal with should you buy this. I'd suggest checking with Breville to see if there is a service center near you before purchasing.

The other issue that nags at me is reliability. There's a lot of electronics in this puppy, and electronics have a way of needing expensive repairs. Plus, the guts of the machine (from pictures I've seen of tear-downs) is loaded with plastic rather than metal. The warranty is only 1 year. I would be more comfortable with at least a 3 year warranty given the price point of the unit. A 3+ year warranty tells me the manufacturer is confident that the unit will last. One year makes me a bit apprehensive.

Both those concerns tempted me to drop the rating, but I'm going to stick with 5 stars since it works well (right now at least), yields great shots, is easy to use, and was thoughtfully designed. Add those up and you get 5 stars in my book. I'll revise the rating down the road should problems occur.

I would rank this as one of the top choices in the $1000 to $1500 segment of the market. (I'd suggest the Gaggia Classic for the sub-$500 segment, the Crossland CC-1 or the Silvia for the $500 to $1000 segment; and the Rocket Giotto or the Quick Mill Andreja the $1,500+ segment. I'm also VERY impressed with the Breville Infuser, which is the baby brother of the double boiler. It's a great value machine, and I compared it to the double boiler in my review:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breville-BES840XL-the-Infuser-Espresso-Machine/dp/B0089SSOR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breville BES840XL the Infuser Espresso Machine</a>). You get a lot of machine for your money and, if paired with a little practice and a good grinder, you can pull some very, very nice shots.

5.0,341.0,"I don't even know where to start. I just got this ""Lamborghini"" of espresso machines, about 2 hours ago and after about 6 tries I pulled a perfect shot.

When I say perfect, I mean double-shot-single-wall-filter-14gr-30-lbs-of-tamper-pressure-200F-9-bars-30-second-extraction-2oz-full-of-crema PERFECT.

I have been using a BES820XL for quite some time and I was very happy with the quality and all my friends always said that my espresso was the best they've ever tried. True, my espresso has always been consistent and close to the coffee I drank throughout Italy.

UNTIL NOW.

I can't believe the difference this machine made. I mean the same coffee (same amount of coffee & same tamper pressure & 30 second extraction) tastes like it's not from the same beans. It tastes like dark chocolate with a very long finish and a delicious aftertaste. The same coffee pulled through BES820XL lacked the finish and wasn't as full-bodied.

The machine is a lot bigger than my BES820XL (I will try to upload a photo later) but it's pure sexinness. I don't even mind that my espresso cups don't fit on top of it when it's under the cupboards (my cabinets are hung a little low).

Besides the obvious difference in the looks between the two machines, this machine is a technological marvel. The PID controls alone are worth it. The PID controls let you keep the temperature pegged at 200F with just over a 1 degree variation. Instant steam means I never have to wait again or hear that pumping noise.

I love the wheels underneath. It makes it so easy to maneuver the machine on the counter. And I also love the fact that you can fill it up right through the top lid.

The ONLY disappointment is the weight of the included tamper. I mean it's great that you can store it right on the machine but for my big hands it's a bit small and too light. I will have to get another tamper (this machine usees a 58mm tamper as opposed to the 51mm on the BES820XL). I've been used to using a nice heavy tamper with a rosewood handle, so I'll probably look for the same one in 58mm.

In conclusion, I LOVE the BDB (Breville Dual Boiler).

I've only had it for 2 hours, so time will tell if it will continue to deliver the results. I will keep updating the review, so stay tuned.

***UPDATE***

I've uploaded 2 photos. On one of them you can see the difference in size between BES820XL (same size as BES830XL) and the new BES900XL.

***UPDATE***

Didn't even read the instructions until now, but it says to soak the water filter for 5 minutes before inserting. I didn't do it (hopefully it won't be an issue). And I just ordered the Smart Grinder&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breville-BCG800XL-Smart-Grinder/dp/B0043EWFAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breville BCG800XL Smart Grinder</a>&nbsp;will my wife kill me? We'll find out tonight. :)

***UPDATE***

This machine is MASSIVE. I don't know where to put it in my small kitchen... It's intruding into the cooking space. I might have to put it somewhere outside of the kitchen. I may have to get a bigger apartment to accommodate this espresso machine. I think in the new apartment I will have a separate coffee & wine room with just my coffee stuff and wine refrigerators, how cool would that be?

***UPDATE***

I keep on pulling perfect shots at 9 bars and get 2 oz in 30 seconds. I am using Lavazza ""perfetto espresso"" ground coffee, which seems to be the perfect grind size. The Smart Grinder should come in within a few days, but I don't see how it can get any better. The espresso I pulled (see the pictures I posted) is as perfect as I've ever had anywhere, even in coffee shops in Italy from freshly roasted and ground coffee.

***UPDATE***

Ran out of Lavazza ""Il Perfetto Espresso"" which was a perfect grind size. Opened a gold can of Lavazza and found the grind size to be too small - I tried pulling shots even with very little tamper pressure and the shots were coming out too slowly about 40 seconds. The Smart Grinder is coming in tomorrow so I am excited. I already bought the Lavazza and Illy whole beans. Will update my review tomorrow.

***UPDATE*** 11/23/2011

Received Breville's Smart Grinder (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breville-BCG800XL-Smart-Grinder/dp/B0043EWFAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breville BCG800XL Smart Grinder</a>) today and started grinding my own coffee. I bought a 2.2 lb bag of Lavazza beans (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lavazza-Super-Crema-Espresso-Whole-Bean-Coffee-2-2-Pound-Bag/dp/B000SDKDM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag</a>) from Amazon, which was delivered super fast by the way.

I played with different settings on the grinder until I got to my double-shot-30-seconds-9-bars perfect shot. The coarsness setting is all the way to the right (the finest setting) and the amount setting is all the way to the left (when the amount setting is in the middle I got too many grinds which is an unnecessary waste of coffee).

The result left me speechless. I got so much crema that my eyes literally popped out of my head like in a cartoon. The taste and aroma were superb. I am finally ""there"". It doesn't get any better than this. You can have a $10,000 espresso machine and the best shot you'll make would be equal to my shot, because there is no room left for improvement.

BES900XL & BCG800XL are a match made in heaven.

***UPDATE*** 11/25/2011

I keep pulling perfect shots. I haven't had a single shot end up in the sink. I haven't even experimented with the pre-infusion or different temperature (I have it at 200F).

***UPDATE*** 11/27/2011

I just thought I'd say that this machine is not for someone who doesn't understand how the correctly pulled espresso shot is supposed to taste like. This machine is not ""set it and forget it"" type of machine. It's not a Nespresso or Keurig. To pull a perfect shot you absolutely HAVE TO make sure all the variables are correct and you have to know what you are doing, which means you HAVE TO do additional research on the following: 1. grind size 2. dosing 3. tamper pressure 4. temperature 5. extraction pressure 6. timing of the shot 7. type of bean, etc. If you are not sure what even one part of this means, please do your research BEFORE buying this machine! This machine does its magic only if you do the CORRECT PREP first!! I guarantee that if you pull a 10-second shot or a 50-second shot, you WILL BE disappointed even with your favorite coffee beans!!!

I also guarantee that if you do all the prep correctly you will be amazed at the quality of your espresso shots!!

I would really hate to see someone write a bad review of this machine because of their own mistakes in grind size, dosing and other variables.

***UPDATE*** 12/9/2011

I keep pulling perfect shots every single day. I did change the settings on the grinder to the finest (all the way to the right) and the amount is two ticks from the left between weaker and 0. If the amount is set to 0 it results in too much wasted coffee.

All in all, I am still extremely happy with BDB and the Smart Grinder.

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask me in the comments below.

***UPDATE*** 1/28/2012

Here is a quick update. I have not had a ""sink shot"" for 2 months straight. Every single shot I pull is absolutely perfect.

I went on a vacation to PR and stopped by a coffee shop, which had a La Marzocco Strada with 2 group heads. La Marzocco Strada is an incredible espresso machine with a hefty price tag and I just couldn't imagine how you can screw up a shot, yet the barista managed to screwed it up! I don't know whether it was his tamper pressure, grind size or something else but it was absolutely disgusting!! Even though I didn't even finish the coffee, it actually made me feel pretty good to be able to pull better shots than La Marzocco Strada! The moral of the story is, prep prep prep!!

***UPDATE*** 3/10/2012

I have been using this machine for almost 4 months. I have pulled probably close to 200 double shots.

The consistency of the machine is incredible. I haven't changed any settings in months and it still pulls perfect shots every time.

I haven't mentioned this before, but it is very important that your espresso cups are warm.

Here is a tip: the quickest way to warm up your espresso cups is to put a little bit of water in them and stick them in a microwave for 30 seconds while you are grinding the coffee.

*** UPDATE *** 11/23/2012

I have now had this machine for over a year. I have not changed any settings in almost an entire year and I still keep pulling perfect shots every single day.

*** UPDATE *** 4/13/2013

Still good! I use it every single day and have already gone through a few cleaning cycles.

I would estimate that I've pulled at least 500 shots in the last year and a half and have not changed any settings on the machine or the grinder in over a year.

I have the temperature set at 195, since when I experimented with different temperatures I found that the lower temp yields a sweeter shot.

If you are still thinking about buying it and comparing it to others - don't even waste time looking for anything else in this price range - there is simply no competition.

*** UPDATE *** 2/4/2014

Still works great! We use it every day, sometimes more than once a day.

We haven't had to change any settings, with the exception of when we lost power the machine reset back to 200F and I had to set it back to 195F, and set the clock.

It would be nice if they would have an auto on feature for different days of the week, because on some days I need the machine to turn on at 5:45am and on some days I don't, I have to remember to turn the auto on feature every evening before we have to get up early and if I forget to shut it off the machine turns on at 5:45am the next day...

It's a minor annoyance for an otherwise excellent espresso machine.",HOLY ESPRESSO BATMAN! THIS THING IS MAGIC,2023-07-17,21174,5425126,1,0.862895715055121
5.0,33.0,"Two years into owning a Breville Dual Boiler, I decided to rewrite my review to reflect my ongoing experience with the product. My initial review was written after using the machine for a month.

I'll preface this review by saying that I am not a coffee snob. I don't have lab equipment by which to test the Ph levels of the final product. But I do know food, and I understand that it's important to most people to get both good coffee and good value from their machines. What you'll find in this review is a pragmatic and practical discussion of this product.

There's a lot to say about this machine. After several years using it, these are my thoughts about this machine, the most important comments at the top:

Manufacturing. I own three Breville appliances, and the way they design and build their products is relatively unique. It's obvious that they think things through - how can they make things more user-friendly? What should the size/shape of the elements be? They try to design great looking appliances that use the right balance of technology and manufacturing to result in awesome machines. And they mostly succeed. Mostly.

The problem I've encountered with both their espresso machines and ovens is that the technological elements - computer-driven boiler, timers, etc. - function great, but the basic elements of the machines - hinges, boilers, etc. - are not the highest quality, and tend to fail over time.

This was the case with my Dual Boiler, which expired a month before the warranty. The pump just...stopped. Breville service was awesome, and had a replacement unit on my doorstep 48 hours later, but it was still a hassel. Similarly, I love my Breville toaster oven and use it daily. Two years into owning this machine, the door spring snapped. With most Breville products, there's no way to order new parts or have the item repaired. In the case of the door spring, a 20 cent part, there was no way to repair the unit as the casing was bolted onto the unit. Breville would ship a new door...the entire door...for $120.

Back to the espresso machine...the overall manufacturing quality is ""pretty good."" Not great, and this underlines the biggest issue with the machine - do they last? I have not found them to, and for my next machine I will be looking to invest in a long-term boiler with less features, rather than technological marvels that futz out after a year.

The coffee. As I said, I'm no coffee snob. I don't want to drink ""swill,"" but I can't score an espresso and distinguish between a 9.5 and a 9.7. I find other espresso machine reviewers to be bossy, prissy and obnoxious about their coffee. My personal experience with the Breville is that it puts out a pretty good shot consistently, with caveats.

Needless to say, great espresso is something of a ""team effort."" You need good beans, a good grinder. What I discovered with the Breville is that this is something of a process. Even choosing only high-quality beans from local roasters, only about half of the coffees I've tried work well with both my grinder and espresso machine. Some roasts clog the grinder, others don't pull great shots from the machine. Some taste acidic and ""burnt"" even though the beans seem great.

However, what I've also found is that when I find a roast that works well with my setup, the Breville performs pretty consistently. If I get superb crema using a specific brand/roast, I tend to get that with most every shot. This has resulted in our trying 20-30 roasts, and settling on five favorites that we rotate.

Pulling shots: As to the process of making a shot of espresso, I still give this machine an A+ in terms of finding a great balance between manual and automatic machines. I hate the idea of moving to a pod machine...expensive and gross. But I don't want to be a barista, either.

The learning curve on the Breville is pretty short, and after years with the machine I can eyeball a portafilter full of fresh grinds and determine if there's too little or too much, and then tamp it correctly to get right in the pressure ""green zone.""

Here is where a lot of the machine's features shine. Grinding, tamping and pulling your own espresso is...kinda messy. The top-loading water feature, drip tray, dual boiler, steam wand...of of these features are as great as advertised, and help make the process as quick and clean as possible.

Special features: Again, the way the user interacts with the machine is really thought through. The drip tray, the magnetic tamper, the wheels - these are all great features that make the machine easier to use.

By far, the headline special feature on this machine is the dual boiler. And yeah...I totally love this aspect. The machine heats up in about five minutes on a cold winter morning, and the dual boiler allows you to pull shot after shot without any down time. I find it's ready to work faster than I can grind and tamp shots, so when I'm making coffees for a dinner party of ten it's me that's slowing things down, not the Breville.

Overall, Breville has done a decent job with this unit. I wanted a machine that had the power to create a coffee shop-grade espresso/latte, and one that minimized the mess and hassle of doing so. The dual boiler is fun and simple to use, and it creates great coffee.

My biggest complaint is that it doesn't seem built to last, which is something I really desire in my kitchenware. I would gladly pay another $1000 if the machine was made to descale locally, and if the pump was going to be running in five or ten years. But like a lot of things, this unit is made to be somewhat disposable.

When this unit gives out, I'll look at Breville again, but I will probably consider a machine in a higher price bracket that has fewer features and better manufacturing.

In the meantime, I'll call the Breville dual boiler 3.5 stars out of 5. Breville would earn an extra star by upping the quality and extending the warranty, but that's where this machine is right now.","Innovative, capable and smart, this Breville carves a solid niche in the semi-automatic machine market.",2023-05-23,21174,766728,1,0.6703853120813232

5.0,7.0,"This is a very quiet machine. I did have a juicer before that was very noisy, so noisy that my 5 year old daughter hid in her room. Now 6 years old, she actually watched as I made Grammy some orange juice and her some apple juice. It extracts a lot of fluid from the fruit. Three average size apples filled a 16 oz glass, and the pulp was fairly dry. It also takes in the fruit really easily, I didn't even have to really push the fruit through. I had a couple pieces of apples that where a little big, and had to use the tool to push the apples through, but they went through fairly quickly. All of the rest of the pieces went through on their own once the machine was turned on.

It comes with a recipe book and directions as to how to put it together. I had a little trouble the first time putting together, but once I figured it out, it is fairly easy to put together. It is also really easy to clean. It comes with a brush (looks like a big toothbrush) to clean, along with a Kuvings Patented Cleaning Tool that helps clean as well. I was very impressed with this machine. It works very well.

The recipe book even has some recipes for ice cream. It is nice to be able to have some healthy treats for the summer.",Wonderful juicer,2023-10-13,25109,5471703,1,0.6099196499961174

The chute hopper is a bean shape which means each and every piece of food that goes in will need to be chopped and diced. Some of the centrifugal juicers have chutes large enough for a whole tomato but this convenience will cost you. If you juice at a speed that can take large amounts of vegetables at a time, you are losing many of the vitamins due to the heat those speeds produce. I would have preferred a round tube but the one provided doesn't change the value or performance at all.
The Kuvings is a beautiful addition to any home and the motor is quieter than expected but do not expect ""silent."" Masticating juicers mimic the chewing action of your mouth vs the puree and spin of a centrifugal model. Slow juicing also reducing that hot foam that usually takes up a 1/4 of your glass which turns so many off, including me. One tip is to put a few ice cubes in your collection container so whatever foam that comes from the natural action of the juice pouring will be reduced even more.
All in all it is a great juicer that produces dry pulp and looks great in the kitchen although the height limits where you can place it. For less money and if you are short on space, the Omega line offers the horizontal ""bull dog stance"" models which fit right under most counters for $200.00 less. The omega also has you working with your arms at a normal level where the vertical units could be a strain for people with limited mobility in the arms.",Pricey,2018-03-25,25109,4383070,0,0.2580422122711668
5.0,5.0,"Planning on doing a video review, will post soon. Been using the Kuvings 950 several times a week for several weeks and I've had no problems at all with it.

There are several key features that I that really distinguish the Kuvings 950 from any of the many juicers I've used over the years-have been juicing over 20 years, so I've been through a lot of them!

Number one has to be the distinct difference in sound level. While it is of course not actually a ""silent"" juicer, it is definitely many times quieter than the juicer I've been using the last few years! I plan to do an audio test between my old juicer vs the Kuvings to compare the decibel levels of the two machines.

I also like the slow RPM ""masticating"" grind action of the Kuvings. Obviously this is what makes it less noisy than a standard high speed juicer, but guess it wasn't such an obvious feature, as I'm not aware of many other companies using the slow RPM solution to noise.

Also love that it is so easy to disassemble and clean! With only 3 or 4 clicks, the entire juice comes apart for easy cleaning. And it's almost as quick and easy to assemble too. Sometimes the center portion of the grinder doesn't seat properly and thus won't allow the rest of the cover to click in. Once you get the hang of it however, it's an easy obstacle to overcome.

All in all, a fantastic juicer! It doesn't hurt that it's so beautifully designed with the gorgeous chrome and black accents. It's a litte on the heavy side, but I'd prefer the added stability to a lighter machine that moves all around when you use it.",Excellent Juicer!,2023-04-24,25109,3946691,1,0.707555675843845

4.0,3.0,"Note:  This is my fourth edit of this review over the past several months.

In retrospect, it appears that I simply was unlucky and received a 'lemon' juicer.  The good news is that Kuvings customer service stuck with me until virtually the entire unit was replaced (two new bowls, new lid, entire new motor unit) and now everything works absolutely great.  It juices with high efficiency (pulp much drier than pulp produced by a centrifugal juicer), is very quiet, never jams and will juice pretty much anything.

When I first received it, it jammed all the time -- even on soft fruits such as apples.  Fibrous vegetables such as celery or ginger were absolutely impossible no matter how finely I pre-chopped them.  The juicer also had to be assembled and disassembled multiple times before it would work right.  There must have been a problem with the safety lock system because it simply would not start.  Eventually, it stopped working entirely.

Kuvings sent me a new bowl early on and it completely fixed the jamming problem.  When the juicer then stopped working entirely, they sent me a replacement motor unit, another replacement bowl and a replacement lid (since those are the three components that are involved in the safety lock mechanism).

5.0,16.0,"I have owned almost all of the floor steamers on the market. When my last one quit steaming, I started researching all of the latest models, trying to find one that fit our needs. We have marble floors in most of the common areas in our home. With four children, two cats and one dog, it is a challenge to keep them clean. I wanted a floor steamer that would get hot enough to sanitize (212 degrees), and be able to hold enough water without constantly refilling. The Haan Multiforce Plus does just that. I can get a good twenty minutes of usage before having to refill the water. It is easy to push while the machine scrubs away nicely on the floor. It dries almost instantly with no streaks and the floors are left with a nice shine. I have also used it on our wood floors with the same results.

The only complaints that I have about the machine is the length of the cord. It is ridiculously short. I find that I have to keep unplugging and plugging it back in as I move to different areas of each room. I will definitely have to invest in an extension cord. Also after working with the machine for more than an hour, my hand begins to hurt. Their is no padding on the handle, as it is solid plastic, so their is nothing to cushion your grip.

The manual states that you should replace the cleaning pads under the machine about every ten minutes. I have found that I can use them up to about an hour before replacing them. I have not used the carpet glide yet, but will definitely update my review when I do. By far the best floor steamer I have used.","Great for deep cleaning, sanitizing and buffing at the same time.",2023-04-11,27940,2873545,1,0.8730455418679732

5.0,61.0,"I am a HUGE steam cleaning fan, particularly steam mopping. It beats the heck out of traditional mopping and there are no cleaners or chemicals to buy, no dirty mop water to deal with, and my floors are really clean with no cleaner residue. The only issue I've ever come across with regular steam mops is that they are not able to clean grout between tiles. That's why I was delighted to have the opportunity to review the Haan Multiforce.

This steam mop is different because it not only steams - it scrubs! Instead of a single, stationary steam surface on the bottom, it has two steam surfaces which move back and forth in a scrubbing motion, all the while delivering loads of steam. Haan calls it CR-motion, and it's crazy fast and forceful. It really does scrub! (Because of how quickly the two steam plates move, the unit is fairly loud when using the scrubbing action.)

It's called the multiforce because it steams, scrubs, buffs and polishes. This is the first steam mop I know of that has all those functions. It is also rated for indoor/outdoor use!!! The scrub brush attachments have plastic bristles to scrub patios, decks, sidewalks and porches. In the 3 months I've been using it, I can say that it performs all those tasks splendidly.

Upon unboxing you'll find you need to snap in the handle and the pole to complete assembly of the machine. (This unit is significantly heavier than a conventional steam mop.) Also included is a carpet glide, 2 sets of ultra micro-fiber cleaning pads, 1 set of buffing pads, 1 set of scrub brush attachments, 12 packages of de-scaling powder, a foam resting mat and a pretty good users manual.

For regular steam mopping, remove the water tank from the front of the machine by pushing the tank removal button, fill it with tap or distilled water, then snap it back into place til you hear a click. Next, attach a set of the ultra micro-fiber cleaning pads. You then have the choice to clean with steam but no scrubbing action, scrub but no steam or steam plus scrubbing action. For steam, press the steam button on the front of the unit. To start the scrubbing action, use your foot to activate the CR-motion button on the base of the machine. Tilt the handle 45 degrees and move the machine back and forth over your floor.

The results are stunning. Hot steam loosens dirt and the micro-fiber pads pick it up. Even dried on or crusty gunk can be removed by keeping the mop over the area for a longer period. The CR-motion is so powerful, I haven't had to physically scrub anything since I got this. And in case you've never used a steam mop before, you'll be amazed at how fast the floor dries. Fast enough to be completely safe on laminate flooring. You are left with extremely clean, dry floors in no time and the only thing left is to throw the dirty pads in the washing machine. I will never go back to a conventional mop.

The micro-fiber pads are designed for cleaning laminate, sealed hard wood, vinyl, porcelain and ceramic tile and sheet vinyl floors. (Haan does not recommend it for unglazed ceramic tile or unsealed hardwood flooring.) You select the floor type with the floor setting button on the front of the machine. Red gives high steam emission for ceramic, stone, tile and other durable flooring. Green gives gentler steam for sealed hardwoods, bamboo, laminates and more delicate flooring.

You will notice it produces a lot of steam. Each of the 2 steam surfaces on the bottom has 10 steam jets that deliver steam heated to 212 degrees - hot enough to sanitize your floor. A full tank of water lasts about 20 minutes, but heat up time is only about 45 seconds.

You use the buffing pads for polishing and shining your clean floors with the CR-motion on and the steam off. I have commercial vinyl tile in my kitchen and I apply floor finish every 6 months. The buffing pads make it gleam! I also have some unfinished pine flooring upstairs which I wax with Butcher's wax every few months and again, the buffing pads bring up a lovely shine to the wax. Haan says you can use them to buff your sealed hardwood floors and marble floors, and they will also bring back a luster to older, no-wax floors.

The scrub brush attachments have plastic bristles and snap onto the steam surfaces. They are designed for outdoor use with some kind of cleaner or detergent. My concrete patio and front porch looked brand new after scrubbing with this machine (and my house is 100 years old!) I didn't use steam but instead, wet the concrete well with water and threw down some powdered detergent. After using the scrubber over the entire surface, I just rinsed with the garden hose. Soooo much easier than scrubbing with a hard bristle push broom and way less water than with a pressure washer.

If you need to use an extension cord, make sure it is at least a 15 amp 16 gauge cord.

Haan doesn't suggest this, but I used the scrub brush attachments with steam on a white porcelain tile bathroom floor with excellent results. The grout is white (a big mistake) and gets dirty in no time. The scrub brushes with steam cleaned it perfectly and the grout looks white again! I was worried it might damage the grout but it didn't in any way. I'm not sure I would use the scrubbing attachments on softer tiles, but it worked great on porcelain. I did reapply grout sealant after scrubbing to try and keep it clean and stain free.

The carpet glide freshens carpets, rugs, and dog beds. (Haan says it works on upholstery, too, but I think the machine is too heavy to hoist up on furniture.) It also deodorizes and sanitizes, which is a great for allergy sufferers. The steam is hot enough to kill dust mites! Haan says you can also use it for removing fresh carpet stains and they give directions for this in the manual, but I haven't had a stain to see how that works. It DOES make my area rugs look and smell wonderful, which is welcome since I have dogs, cats and kids.

A few tips: buy extra cleaning pads. With all steam mops, you need to attach dry pads when the ones you are using become saturated because they don't glide well when super wet. Depending upon the size of your home, 6-8 sets of pads is a good idea. Also, if you live in an area with very hard water, as I do, use distilled water. It's cheap insurance to protect your machine from damaging mineral build-up. Finally, you can machine wash and dry the pads on delicate and low heat, but air drying makes them last longer and remain more absorbent.

I'm so happy with this machine. The ability to scrub grout AND scrub outdoor surfaces makes it the most used cleaning machine in my house. If you have hard surface flooring and/or outdoor patios, decks, and porches, you may appreciate the Haan Multiforce as much as I do.

UPDATE 7/14/2017: 4 years later and I still use this steam mop at at least weekly. I've never had an issue with it and it remains my favorite appliance in the house.

2.0,4.0,"I have been steam cleaning our 12"" wide Walnut hardwood floors for the past 3-years and am a big fan of the chemical-free approach. In the past 3-years, I've purchase two different steam cleaners. They were:

Oreck Steam-It Steam Wand - $137 currently on Amazon
HAAN SS-22A Multiforce Plus - $229.73 on Amazon

I was initially drawn to the Oreck model because you could move it upside down to clean tile on a wall or glass without it leaking. It also had a consistantly high temperature which helps burn bacteria at a faster rate (ie - 7 seconds in a spot to kill 99% of the bacteria). And I liked that it held enough water in the chamber that I could steam for about 30-minutes before having to refill the water cartridge.

It also turns out that it has a wheel control option on the handle that allows me to very specifically increase or decrease the amount of water going through the holes. If you have too much water going out, it creates mini puddles on your hardwood floors, which then dry and the floors appear spotty in the right light. So I would dial down the amount of water it would consume to be just enough to move the steamer at a slow pace, at an attempt to kill as much bacteria as possible while still being somewhat efficient with my time. This was a great product for about 1.5-years. Then it stopped working. I think the reason is because I used hard water in the unit and left used water in the tank instead of emptying it out afterward. I read somewhere that you can take apart the handle of the unit and clean it to re-engage one of the two ""on buttons"" to make it work again.

During this time, we have a friend who is helping to clean our residence, once every 2-weeks. She owns the HAAN SS-22A. She said she like it more than our Oreck model because it was easier for her to push, had two pads that make contact with the floor and you could remove the water tank from the unit to refill. On top of that, I read that it also had the ability to use scrub brushes for outdoor deck use. You can step on a button and it mechanically buffs the floor by moving the two pads back and forth at a rapid rate. When activated, it even makes the HAAN easier to move around in any direction and the small vibrations decrease the friction of both pads in contact with your floor.

However, when using the HAAN SS-22A Multiforce, I noticed that some of the features and accessories that ended up being ""sales closers"" for me were not realistically helpful. And some of the features missing that the Oreck model had ended up being more important, in terms of getting a streak free, bacteria killing, nice clean floor.

1) As far as I can tell, the HAAN does not have a way to micro-control the amount of steam that comes out of it. The lowest setting that it gives you (non-turbo) kicks out too much water and the heat of the steamer, when moving slow enough to kill even 30-40% of the bacteria, leaves small puddles on the floor. Once they dry, my floors look super streaky. That's bad.

2) I wondered if having two pads on the HAAN model, connecting and cleaning my floors would increase the amount of cleaning vs. the one pad on the Oreck, would result in a better clean. Without being scientific, I wasn't able to notice much of a difference.

3) Easy of pushing the unit. I think the reason why our friend thought that the HAAN was an easier unit to push is because it's water tank is super super tiny. In fact, I only get through about a 10'x12' area on my floors by the time the tank runs out. I have to turn off the steamer, place it on the hot pad so it doesn't burn my floor, pop the removable tank off (which is nice) and fill it back up again. When you have an much floor as we have, it ends up extending the amount of time you're spending steaming your floors.

4) Cord length -- not a big deal because you can buy an extension cord, but the factory power cord length on this unit is maybe 12-15' long? It's way too short and I find myself walking through puddles of water to unplug the relocate to the next closest power outlet, again extending the time I'm spending cleaning my floors.

Overall, there are a lot of great Amazon reviews and praises for both of these products. I think the accessories, hot pad and removable tank are great features of the HAAN. But if you're main goal is efficiently cleaning and killing bacteria on your floors, the Oreck product, hands down in the better product. And you'll save $92 when purchasing the Oreck Steam-It Steam Wand.","Oreck Steam-It Steam Wand vs. HAAN SS-22A Multiforce Plus -- do clean, streak free floors matter more than accessories?",2020-08-05,27940,1969363,0,0.4751842398039384

4.0,0.0,"The Ecolution Evolve series of cookware has the Hydrolon non-stick surface, which is a PTFE (Teflon) coating manufactured without PFOA, commonly used in other pans to apply PTFE to the surface. PFOA is suspected of being a cancer-causing agent, and though it doesn't persist in significant amounts in a pan once its manufacture is completed, it may be harmful to those involved in or near the manufacturing process, and trace amounts are found all over. Some consumers prefer to buy products that don't use it in the manufacturing process.

PTFE itself, according to the American Cancer Society, is *not* suspected of causing cancer or other disease. However, if it's overheated, to over 550 degrees F, it may start to break down and give off fumes that can (rarely) cause flu-like or more serious respiratory symptoms in humans, and that can harm or even kill sensitive pet birds. 550 degrees is hotter than a normal cooking temperature, so that's not a concern for most people, but even so some prefer not to mess with PTFE either.

As for the other qualities of the pan, it's big, deep, with a heavy glass lid and insulated handles, well designed for its purpose. The only thing I'm not wild about (yet) is that it's aluminum, and I'm used to a heavier material that holds heat more and is maybe sturdier. Works fine, though, and the aluminum is lighter to move around and conducts heat well. I like it for home fries, which are easy to make in pots, but extra easy after frying chicken or, my favorite, seafood in this.

Pros

-- Relatively inexpensive for a quality pan this size
-- No use of PFOA, a potential carcinogen, in manufacturing process
-- Insulated handles work well
-- Oven safe up to 350 F
-- Easy to hand clean
-- Can be washed in the dishwasher (but then you may need to season it again after a while)
-- Lifetime repair-or-replace warranty (but must return pan plus $8 for S&H)

Cons

-- Not for use with metal utensils
-- Some may prefer to avoid PTFE",Pros and cons of this PFOA-free PTFE (Teflon) non-stick pan,2022-09-29,28896,913439,0,0.4696367137511005

The fryer is packaged with the lid inverted, so you just unscrew and screw it back on.

I fried ten chicken tenderloins all at once. It seems to fry much faster than when using an ordinary frying pan.

The chicken came out tender and crispy.

Now, this fryer is PFOA free. This is a healthier alternative in nonstick cookware. PFOA is short for perfluorooctanoic acid (also called C8), a synthetic chemical compound that is used, along with PTFE, to manufacture certain fluoropolymer- and telomer-based consumer products, including nonstick pan coatings like Teflon.

It is reassuring to know this fryer doesn't contain that possible danger.

Nonstick coatings (e.g., Teflon) are notorious for having health risks; read the Wikipedia page on PFOA if you want to know more. So, this is a PFOA-free nonstick pan, and that's a huge selling point. I tried frying some eggs to put the nonstick capabilities to the test, and it works like a champ -- no sticking problems.

Pros:
1. Nonstick surface is PFOA free and is very effective as a nonstick pan
2. Aluminum pan is lightweight and distributes heat well
3. Glass top lets you see what's going on in there.
4. Silicone handle is comfortable and stays relatively cool to the touch; same for the helper handle at the front.
5. Oven safe to 350 degrees

I read other reviews that complained about a loose handle, but I don't understand that.

5.0,3.0,"I just finished my holiday baking, and I used this kitchen scale to weigh ingredients when I made recipes handed down through generations. It didn't fail me once.  I compared the measurement to my trusty Salton digital scale, and the two were identical, which gave me complete confidence in the readings. This scale has a slightly larger face than the Salton, and for that reason, I like it better.

This scale can measures grams and pounds/ounces, and it switches from one to the other with a touch.  It also has units of milliliters and fluid ounces, although I have no idea why the volume measurements are there since a scale (for weight) cannot measure volume.

Like most good kitchen digital scales, the Surpah has a TARE function for measuring that resets the scale to zero when something is on it.  This is critical since you don't want to measure, say, shortening directly on the scale.  You put a bowl on it, zero out the scale, and the put the ingredient in the bowl for weighing.  It doesn't matter how heavy or large your bowl is as long as the scale is set to zero right before you add your ingredient.

The tempered glass face measures approximately 8"" x 7"", and it cleans easily with a wipe.  The frame/back is a white plastic.  The display is not backlit, but I found the black-on-gray numbers easy to read all the same, primarily because they are large (about 3/4"" high.)  It uses an included lithium battery which should last for years if my experience with other kitchen scales similarly powered is any indication.  Note:  I received a sample for review.

4.0,0.0,"This is a very attractive looking scale. The top is glass and the center is open, so you can see the counter below. It gives it a very minimal look that blends in well. Its the type of scale that I don't feel looks out of place on the kitchen counter, saving me the trouble of having to stow it in a drawer when its not being used.

The numbers are easy to read (about 1 inch tall) but there is a bit of glare from the glass if used directly under a bright light. It offers measurements in grams, fluid ounces, pounds/ounces and mls. You cycle through the choices by pressing the control pad.

The control pads are touch sensitive, so theres no crevices around a button that will trap dirt. The glass top is very easy to clean, but it is a fingerprint magnet.

It uses a CR2032 battery (the disk type of battery) which keeps the overall thickness of the scale down. I would have preferred an AA or AAA battery since I can get those in rechargeable formats.

The accuracy seems spot on. I tested it against a postal scale at work that is regularly calibrated, and had no significant difference in measurement between the two. The total capacity of the scale is a little over 11 pounds.

It has a tare function so you can zero out the scale when something is on it (e.g., put a measuring cup on the scale, zero it out, then add ingredients to get the weight of the just the ingredients and not the cup). It works well, but there is a small lag from the time you press the tare control pad (which is also the on/off control) and having the scale zero out.

The downside of the compact size is that the measurement platform is a bit small for some tasks. It measures 8 inches wide and 7.25 inches tall.

Well worth a look if you need a compact scale thats easy to use and looks nice.

We have several air purifiers that we ran 24/7, but we could still smell it. Then the Vornado arrived.

The Vornado is more advanced than our other air purifiers that just have filters. This unit kills viruses, bacteria, mold, and kills gasses. The Silverscreen and UV light take it to another level.

We set the Vornado in the hallway, near the bathroom. The difference was almost immediate! The odor was completely gone. We still have the other air purifiers in the other rooms running, but the Vornado makes all the difference. We can definitely tell when it's not on.

Fortunately, the odor under the house is beginning to fade. However, the Vornado will still be used. We noticed that we seem to breathe better now and have not had as many problems with spring allergies that we normally have. We will keep running the Vornado and will probably buy more to replace our other air purifiers. This thing is much more advanced and we are very happy with it.",Amazing!

3.0,0.0,"I've noticed a slight lessening in my allergy symptoms since starting to use this. I don't think it did anything at all to remove VOCs, though. I bought a memory foam mattress that off-gassed like mad (and the off-gassing odor is VOC-laden). After leaving it in my 100 st ft bedroom for more than a week with this filter running on high day and night, there was absolutely no difference in the smell of the room.

It is a pretty big machine, but it did fit OK in my bedroom. The noise level on sleep mode is quite tolerable. On high, it's like a jet taking off (OK, not that loud, but I didn't want to be in the room with it). And this one isn't ionizing, so there's no ozone to worry about.  So while it may have helped a bit, it's not enough to justify the price tag or ongoing expense of filters.

4.0,6.0,"I'm allergic to juniper and maple pollen and I have 3 indoor cats. I use Vornado air circulators during the summer and a Vornado humidifier during the winter, all of which are way past their warranty dates of 5 years and all are still going strong - so I was excited to try this air purifier.

My main living area is too large for this, so I have it in a 13 x 15 bedroom. I keep the door shut and I can smell the difference in air quality when I walk into the bedroom. I have a larger Honeywell Enviracaire in my living area and I can tell it's not cleaning the air as well as the Vornado.

The Vornado is stylish. The control panel will tell you when a filter, the silverscreen or the UV bulb needs replaced. It's quiet. I like some noise when I sleep so I keep it on the low speed, even though there is a sleep setting.

The filters should last slightly over a year if the air cleaner is run 24/7, as well as the UV bulb lasting the same amount of time. The pre-filter can be vacuumed. The HEPA filter replacement price is reasonable, but I have no idea how much the UV bulb will cost, as it's not listed on Vornado's site. The silverscreen panel is supposed to last 5 years.

I'm concerned that silverscreen technology may be a gimmick, but I've relied on Vornado for 8+ years for my fans and humidifiers and they haven't let me down yet","Fresh, clean air",2019-08-05,32642,3800345,0,0.1419700480409224

Well this Vornado goes one up by offering the UV treatment system, which really does work.  It has the same auto fan speed and looks even more sleek and modern than my Plasmawave.  I really like this model as it feels like something that's new and innovative instead of the same ""me too"" systems out there that sell for less, but are louder and have less features.

5.0,4.0,"The Vornado PCO 300 Silverscreen Enhanced Air Purifier covers up to 175 square feet. It has three air flow settings (that you can lock) and attacks and destroys airborne allergens, bacteria, odors, and harmful gasses. You don't need to change the settings  the air purifier senses dust and odor levels and automatically adjusts its output.

I've been very happy so far with the Vornado PCO 300 Silverscreen Enhanced Air Purifier. I have two cats and two litter boxes and I've been using this in the room where we keep their litter boxes and it is working wonderfully. Before I got this I was using a Honeywell Air Purifier which worked fine but is loud and it was becoming increasingly difficult to find replacement filters for it. I find that the Vornado air purifier eliminates odors better than the Honeywell Air Purifier and it is a lot quieter. So quiet, in fact, that when I first got it I kept checking to make sure it was on! There is a sleep function you can use at night but I find the Air Purifier is so quiet I don't need to activate it. While the Air Purifier comes with an instruction manual, you don't really need it as the Air Purifier is simple to use - you basically plug it in and it runs. It really does a great job of masking odors - I barely even know the litter boxes are there!

5.0,4.0,"Air cleaners in the US are voluntarily tested in independent labs and then graded according to their Clean Air Delivery Rate, or CADR. The CADR is a volume measured in cubic feet per minute or CFM. Three separate measures are reported: one for smoke [tobacco] (ranging from 10-450 CADR), dust (ranging from 10-400 CADR) and pollen (ranging from 25-450 CADR). The higher the number, the more effective. The numbers for the Vornado are in the middle of the pack (114, 135, 153 CADR).

If you have a room that is 10'x10' with an 8 foot ceiling, the manual says you get 10-12 air changes per hour (ACH) when the machine is on full blast. Not bad. In a small room, a full ACH happens in 5-6 minutes. That is about 10 times what you typically expect for room-to-room air exchange.

So what happens to the air that actually moves through the machine? There are a few more weird acronyms to know. The MERV or Minimum efficiency reporting value is a scale of 1-20 used to rate the effectiveness of air filters. MERV ratings from 17-20 are classified as true HEPA filters. The Vornado filter is true HEPA with a MERV rating above 17 but some argue this distinction is a marketing ploy. The EPA states that filters with a MERV rating between 7-13 are likely to be nearly as effective as true HEPA filters. Admittedly if you are the one who is sensitive to pollen or allergens you may want every advantage you can get.

The Vornado also runs air though its patented silver screen technology which means that the air passes though a UV light with a screen that is cleaned by titanium dioxide. The EPA cautions that the exposure time to the UV rays may be insufficient to kill all the viruses and spoors passing through the system. As a more practical note, the blue UV light may be annoying at night when you are trying to sleep.

There is also a carbon filter that takes care of smells. Your mileage is going to vary depending on a host of local factors ranging from what speed you are running the cleaner, what kind and how severe are the contaminants, where the cleaner is located in the room, how the room and building are constructed, etc.

I did a little reading on the EPA website where they have a guide to home air cleaners.  You can do your own research at the portion of the EPA website that deals with portable air cleaners. You can also look at the California EPA Air Resources Board for more information. What I got from all this reading is that ozone generation is very bad and a portable air cleaner is no substitute for washing sheets, vacuuming and dusting.

Despite all the ""nay-saying"" about the effectiveness of portable air cleaners in general, I still have the Vornado sitting next to my apartment front door and my kitty litter box. It quietly runs in the background. At low speed it is no louder than my refrigerator. Aside from wiping down the outside, I don't plan on giving it a second thought for the next 9,000 hours or so, when I first have to change the filters.",Effective HEPA air cleaner with good specs,2023-10-14,32642,5375220,1,0.9030926235367336
5.0,6.0,"With several people in the house with allergies, we have multiple air purifiers, and this one outdoes them all in several respects. First, the size of the particles picked up is amazing -- the combination of a permanent pre-filter, a carbon filter, a UV bulb and silverscreen filters results in picking up (and destroying, not capturing) particles down to .0001 microns. This includes bacteria and viruses, and is a real help to those who have asthma or other respiratory conditions, as it captures or destroys pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, odors and gasses. As a bonus, the unit does not emit ozone.

The unit is fairly lightweight and compact, weighing 17 pounds and standing 21 inches tall. There are three speed settings; the lowest runs very quietly, the highest is noticeable but not ear-splitting, similar to white noise. This is an attractive and unintrusive device for its class. A particle sensing mode monitors particles and adjusts the fan accordingly; the odor sensing mode does the same for gasses and odors. Sleep mode automatically senses low/no light and adjusts to the lowest setting, when activity is low and allergens tend to settle. The controls are intuitive and simple, and can be locked.

The web site and description say the unit will operate effectively in rooms up to 220 square feet, but the manual sets it at 175 square feet.

With all these filters, it might be expensive to replace them, but the design means they need to be replaced less frequently. The HEPA filter, carbon filter and UV bulb should be replaced every 9000 hours, which would be about a year and a week if run continuously. The silverscreen filters need to be replaced every 5 years. The operating manual says you can sign up for an automatic delivery of filters, but I was unable to find that service on the company's web site,[...] Also, the only filter available under Accessories on their site was the HEPA filter, at a little over forty dollars (available on Amazon for a bit over twenty), but I bet these filters will be available in the future, and will update this review. The control panel has indicators for each of the four filters (carbon, HEPA, UV bulb and silverscreen).

Comes with a remarkable 5 year warranty.

5.0,0.0,"I had purchased a top of the line steam mop five years ago and was dismayed at the amount of water that was left on my floors.  I had to mop the water up to keep it from damaging the floor.  The Electrolux Precision Steamer does not have that problem at all.  The water heats up quickly and, if you use the right setting for the floor, it gives off just enough steam to do the job.

The cord is extremely long, which allows me to go from front to back and side to side in the rooms I use it in.  I have only used it on tile floors as I am waiting to hear back from my wood floor manufacturer (Shaw) to see if I can use the steamer on the floor without ruining it.  The booklet with the steamer tells the consumer to check with the manufacturer before use so I will update this if I can use the product on the wood floors.  If not, I am thrilled with it on the tile floors.

I like that the mop head is so big (less work for me) and that they give you two floor mats so you are not constantly having to stop mopping in order to rinse it out.  It heats quickly and is able to get into that tight spot under the kitchen and bathroom cabinets.

Overall, I think it is a great product and recommend it highly.",Great steam mop - so many improvements from my last one (five years ago),2023-01-10,33944,5498882,1,0.5251914686333538
5.0,0.0,"I've used a couple other steamers in the past but they weren't as effective as this one. I always went back to a pail and mop when I wanted to get the floor really clean. This Electrolux Precision Bare Floor Steamer is different. It's better than the others. Here are the things that make it stand out: The mop head is larger than others I've seen. It's 15 inches wide by 6 inches so it covers a lot of floor with each sweep. That means less time to do a large room. And the cord on this steamer is really long, it's 30 feet. For me that is really important because our whole downstairs is porcelain tile and vinyl planking tile. Our kitchen, dining nook, family room, hall, dining room, living room, master bath and laundry room are all hard surface. That's a lot of area to mop and with pets and family members tracking dirt in all day, it needs frequent cleaning. With this steamer I don't have to unplug it many times to do all the rooms.

This steamer comes with two cleaning pads that attach with Velcro. I just set the pad on the floor, position the mop head above it and then lower and press down and it's ready to go. There's a cloth tab on the back side of the pad that I just step on and pull the mop up when I want to remove it to clean it. This makes it very easy and the pad can cool for a minute before I pick it up and rinse it out. The water chamber is easy to fill and the water heats very quickly, like in just a couple minutes. There are 3 heat settings, one for ceramic or porcelain tile, one for vinyl and one for sealed wood floors. A switch on the front of the machine lets me change from one to the other in seconds. The steam is very hot and there is a step-on lever on the top of the mop head that lets me switch between normal and intense steam just by stepping on it.

I like using hot steam rather than chemical or other cleaners because we have pets and I am always concerned about them ingesting things that they shouldn't. The steam works even better than cleaners for most of the dirt that accumulates on the floor. This steam mop is the best that I have seen and it finishes the job more quickly than any other tool I've used.

4.0,0.0,"My review title is what I love MOST about this floor steamer: that it will fit underneath the kitchen cabinet ""overhang"" - my older steamer did not and I'd still have to get down on my hands & knees to clean there. I also love the extra burst of steam that shoots out the side if you have extra gunk to clean up - just press the orange pedal on the floor nozzle.

It has 3 settings (tile, vinyl and wood/laminate) but I leave mine on medium because all I have in my condo is vinyl and carpeting. I have 2 adult cats and recently added a new kitten to my ""family"" and I don't like using chemical cleaners on my floors.

My older steamer never seemed to get hot enough to kill germs. This one does. Although I don't have a temperature probe to get a true measurement, the pad certainly feels hot enough when I pick it up to toss into the washer, after letting it cool for awhile.

What I don't like about this steamer? The water tank is impossible to remove without using a rubber husband. There is no grip on it, although it is getting easier the more I remove it. At first I had to use both the rubber husband and a pair of pliers. And, yes, I know about pushing the button....maybe mine has a small defect. A one-star deduction for this problem.

Other features:
It comes with 2 washable pads. One fill of the water tank will last about 20 minutes. Heats up in under 2 minutes. It has a long 30 foot cord.

After mopping, there was very little visible dirt on the pad and I know there should have been more.  But this Electrolux is very different. It cleans my floors much better than the Eureka as I recall. The pad was visibly dirty. My tile floors look cleaner than I can remember - an actual shine. I used near distilled water, so that probably helped considerably. I got another steam mop in November 2011.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sienna-Aqua-Laser-Steam-Mop/dp/B004JJKO5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sienna Aqua Laser Steam Mop</a>. It worked suitably. Eventually I gave my previous steamers to my daughters, so I can't do a side-by-side comparison anymore. However, this one is definitely a keeper.

There are three different floor type settings: Wood, Tile and Vinyl. My only very minor critic is that the water reservoir is small and it is somewhat slippery to grasp to detach from the mop. But on the other hand, you can see the water level very easily and estimate the amount of water you need to finish. I refilled it once for my downstairs which is mostly tile - about 1500 square feet. It heats up very quickly and has a really useful foot activated side steam sprayer for stubborn stains or dirty spots.

The microfiber cleaning pad attaches with Velcro strips and is machine washable. A spare cleaning pad is included. The 30 foot cord is exceptionally long and heavy duty. They even included a power cord retainer to keep the coiled cord in place. The swivel base makes it easy to maneuver into tight spaces and is thin enough to fit under kitchen counters. The 15 inch wide head is wider than most to minimize the number of strokes required to clean a given area.

Also the pistol grip is ideal to make it easy to grasp versus a simple pole mop such as the Eureka. It definitely makes a difference in the effort required to mop a large area.  Look at the oblique view of the Electrolux and you will see why it is better.

It arrived in I believe two (maybe three) separate packages, but all at the same time. I assembled it in a little less than 2hours or so. When assembling, just be sure that you tighten the screws well enough to hold, but not too tight as to damage the holes. Other than that, assembly was a breeze. The tower is extremely sturdy and holds all of my Home Theater equipment very well. Five Shelves, each at different intervals. real wood with a nice brush finish (its 1"" plywood, but unless someone is actually inspecting it closely, you really just cannot tell).

HOWEVER, there is one caveat, something I don't recall seeing mentioned in other reviews.  Every single piece--and we're talking around 15 total pieces--came with a couple of stickers attached (most were small but a couple were quite large).  Having to peel off all these completely unnecessary stickers was bad enough, but every sticker left a gummy residue!  Now, I know it's possible to create stickers that adhere without leaving residue, so you would think the manufacturer would at least use that type of sticker, but no.  My husband is an even-tempered man, but he was about ready to throw the whole kit and caboodle out the door because of these stickers.  In fact, I had to go out and get a can of WD-40 to remove the sticky residue.  He would peel off the stickers, I would use the WD-40 on the pieces and give them back to him, and he would assemble them.  Even with both of us working together, it still took a while to get the whole tower finished.  I would have given this item five stars were it not for the supreme aggravation and waste of time caused by these terrible stickers!

5.0,0.0,"This dual-function digital kitchen scale and timer is very attractive, with a sleek titanium-toned metal platform and a charcoal-toned back panel, made with the quality that one would expect to find with a tablet computer.  It is just under 9 1/2 in. x 6 in. and has a handy hole for hanging, which saves space in my small kitchen.  There are four feet underneath that self-adjust and give about 1/8 in. of clearance to protect it from any moisture on the countertop.

The blue LED display has 3/4 in. tall numbers that are very easy on the eyes.  There are four well-spaced, touch-sensitive buttons to control the scale and timer functions.  There is even an auto-off function to conserve the 3 AAA batteries that are included.  The chirping alarm is loud and persistent enough to be noticeable but not annoying.

The scale is accurate to the gram or tenth of an ounce.  Maximum capacity is 5 kilograms or 11.4 pounds.  It is indeed very accurate when compared to my other scales and can be calibrated if necessary.  The tare function is handy in the kitchen when measuring ingredients.

MeasuPro provided a sample of this scale for testing and evaluation and stands behind it with a two year warranty against manufacturing defects.

5.0,0.0,"I have a couple of kitchen scales and they all take up too much room. Most scales have the body of the scale and then something that somehow sticks up that bounces up and down as you add weight. This scale is more like a bathroom scale that has one solid plane across the top surface. Nice.

This scale is about the size of a small tablet (smaller than an iPad, more like a Kindle Fire). It slides easily into a drawer or between other items in a cupboard. I love the fact that it doesn't take much space.

On on/off controls are easy to use and it's pretty easy to reset the tare. The weight displays in pounds, ounces, and one decimal place (for example, 1 pound 4.3 ounces).

This scale also has a kitchen timer. The timer isn't especially useful for me, but it's nice. I already have a timer on my oven, microwave, and phone. It's still handy though.

This is a very nice scale that does a good job and doesn't take up too much room in my kitchen.

5.0,6.0,"One of the nicest digital food scales I have seen online or in brick & mortar stores. Very impressed with this scale's form and function.

We do a lot of cooking in our kitchen and have always struggled with recipes that provide measurements in quantities other than your standard cup & teaspoon... measurements like grams, fluid ounces, milliliters and even ounces (like with cut up fresh fruit). This Smart Weigh scale solves that issue, and it does so in fantastic style.

This scale was delivered quickly, safely & securely in its manufacturer's boxing, wrapped quite well inside within form fitting packing material... and it arrived in outstanding condition. This scale requires three AAA batteries (included) which were easy to insert into the battery compartment found on the unit's underside.  The instructions are straightforward and easy to follow, though you really do not need them (the scale is very easy to operate).

This really is nice a looking piece of equipment; the scale's brushed stainless finish goes very well with all of the appliances in our kitchen, and its LCD numbers are large and easy to read -- especially against the nicely contrasting blue backlight. At about 10 x 6 inches, this scale can sit or be stored just about anywhere without getting in the way.

If you navigate to the scale's main sales page, I uploaded pictures showing the unit - it really is an elegant device and looks great on our countertop. The pictures may be found on that main page by scrolling down to where the ""Most Helpful Customer Reviews"" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the ""Product Images From Customers"" section. We created a simple fruit salad that was just over one pound, and the scale weighed it exactly. Well done.

The function buttons are very responsive, requiring only the slightest touch to turn it on or off, reset the tare weight (in order to get the net weight of items within your bowl), or switch between lbs/ounces, grams, milliliters and fluid ounces. We tested the scale using two, five and ten pound exercise weights and the results were right on the money even when pushed to its 11.4 pound max. It is an accurate machine and really seems to be well constructed.

The fact that it has a built in timer is an excellent bonus, as we often find the need for one more timer whenever our stove and microwave are already in use. We tested the timer at varying lengths of time, and it functioned perfectly too.  As a battery saver, after about 60 seconds of inactivity the scale will automatically shut itself off.

The scale's documentation notes that there is a two year manufacturer's warranty, so if an issue arises before that two year period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this scale gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.

If you are looking for a scale of this style and size, for use similar to what I have described above, then we totally recommend this scale to you. This Smart Weigh digital scale is easy to setup & use, easy to read, and we found it to be very reliable.

5.0,2.0,"How do I use my digital kitchen scale?  I use it when measuring ingredients accurately for recipes, when dividing dough, when filling canning jars.  I use it to weigh spun alpaca fiber when it comes off the niddy-noddy.  I use it every day, sometimes even many times a day.  So when the manufacturer offered to send me the Smart Weigh SNT100, I jumped on it.  Well, not exactly jumped on it; the maximum weight for this little kitchen scale is just over 11 pounds.  But I was happy to have the opportunity to try it out and even happier to discover that I like this new scale even more than my old standby digital scale.

Whats good about this scale?  First and foremost, its the backlit readout.  Rather than turning on extra lighting to be able to see weights, I can read this immediately and with no extra lighting. I calibrated mine to find that it read weight correctly right out of the box.

Second, its the ability to change from grams to ounces and back again without having to pick up the unit.  The button on the front of the unit allows you to select just the measurement unit you need.  Now you can use European metric recipes directly without having to convert to the American measurement system.

Third, its the built-in timer right at your hand when you need it. No need to stop what you're doing to find and set a timer.

Although you need to use this scale on a hard, flat surface, you can get it out of the workspace by hanging it on the kitchen wall.  A hole for hanging it up graces the top of the scale.

Overall, this is a great little scale.  I am happy to recommend it for every good cook.

5.0,0.0,"Are you struggling with space in your kitchen? I think most of us do, which is why I especially love this combination timer and scale! With a hole on one end for hanging (no more counter space or cupboard space), it has a small footprint even when it is setting down.

It accurately measures even small amounts (less than one ounce) and yet goes up to more than fourteen pounds. You can easily set the tare weight (when you want to measure something in a cup or bowl) by pushing the button that says ""Tare."" Yep, that easy. You can alternate between metric and imperial by pushing the kg/lb button repeatedly, cycling through.

The timer is also easy to set and can be used while it hangs. You push the timer button then minute and seconds, then push it again to start. Perfect to even carry into the next room with you if you want to keep it handy where you can hear it.

I do a lot of canning, so I especially appreciate that it will weigh the larger amounts, but also watch my food intake, and am happy to be able to weigh the ounces that are appropriate for meals. Well, at least so far no one has told me it is OK to have a pound of Prime Rib for dinner. Two ounces equals a serving. Sigh.

It does turn off automatically, or you can turn it off immediately pushing the Tare button till it shuts off. Batteries are included and easily installed.

I received a complimentary sample to test for a review and am very happy with this. Since my daughter's kitchen is much smaller than mine, I suspect it will end up ""relocated"" when she discovers it in my kitchen and I will discover her using it the next time I go over.

 I got this scale to replace one I had for 4 years that just up and died. The features included in this scale were far superior to other brands for the same price I paid.
 My number one usage for this scale was for pour over coffee to weigh my beans and water from bloom to brew. The fact that it has many types of measurements and a timer were perfect.
 My only complaint is that the display turns off while I'm making my pour over. I would think that while gradually adding weight the display would not turn off. I find myself having to reset in between several steps of my brewing process which is bothersome.
 I also wish you could use the timer and scale at the same time, however it is one or the other. I end up using my phone for the timer while I am weighing on the scale.

5.0,0.0,"These standard-size baking cups come in a set of a dozen and are made of sturdy, heat-resistant silicone. The saturated pastel colors are very attractive, perfect for Easter or birthday parties.

The cups are non-stick, so the best part of the cupcake doesn't go to waste, as is often the case with paper cups. They can also be used to make chocolate shells, candy, soap, or candles.

The silicone is also waterproof and the cups don't flatten when filled, so they can go directly on a baking sheet and can be used for serving ice cream, pudding, gelatin, candies, or nuts.

5.0,0.0,"I received a complimentary sample of these to test for my review.

I hate eating cupcakes and muffins off of paper. It feels so tacky. But how else can you do it? That's where these wonderful little cupcake liners come in handy. I pop them in my cupcake tray and have instant decorative and functional little cups. Best of all, I can easily peel them off and eat my muffin without a bit of paper!

It feels so ADULT! And lest you think it is only for cupcakes, these also freeze. A tip of got from a friend is to go ahead and serve up your ice cream in these in advance. Then, when you are ready, simply grab one and put it on the plate with a slice of cake. The best part about serving your ice cream this way is that the mess stays inside of the cup and doesn't melt into the cake.

Five stars, I'm really liking these.

Edited: As an additional use, I am now using these for small snacks on my granddaughter's plate - she likes her food in different ""compartments"" and it actually makes eating more fun for her smaller appetite. I got the idea after reading on Facebook about using an ice tray to separate foods for kids who are picky eaters, just smaller dabs of food.

5.0,0.0,"I tried silicone baking cups a few years ago, and wasn't happy with them because they were floppy and didn't hold my batter in the correct shape.  When I had the opportunity to test and review these cups, I decided to give silicone baking cups another chance.

I used them this weekend to make Father's Day muffins, and they worked perfectly.  I tried six of them in muffin pans, and six just on a cookie sheet, and I'm happy to report that they were rigid enough to hold their shape while baking, and that the muffins popped right out without any breakage.  They also hand washed like a dream with just soap and water, although they are dishwasher safe.  They are also BPA-free, which is important to me, and being silicone they don't stain or absorb flavors or odors.  My set came with three each of a cheery pastel blue, pink, yellow and green.

My only complaint is that these are a little smaller than I'd like for baking muffins.  They're the size of paper cupcake liners, and that's probably what I'll use them for.  Very nice!","A little bit small, but they produce perfect results!",2023-08-07,38144,5155408,1,0.7918023571013002

5.0,0.0,"These are awesome!  I was really in the mood for reese's peanut butter cups tonight, but A) they're just soooo unhealthy for you, and B) it was midnight, and I didn't feel like going out to get any.  So in a double boiler I melted 1/4 cup of Cocoa Butter, 1/4 cup refined Coconut Oil, 1/2 cup of Cacao Powder, 1/4 cup Raw Honey, and just a pinch of pink Himalayan salt.  I put 12 of these cupcake liners into 2 cupcake pans, and poured just a bit of chocolate into each one, enough to cover the bottom, and popped them into the freezer for just a few minutes.  Then I added a spoonful of natural creamy peanut butter into the center of each one, reheated the chocolate, and poured the rest of it over them.  Then I popped them back into the freezer to chill completely.  Within the hour, I had a much healthier, delicious candy, that looks just like reese's peanut butter cups.

So... these liners went from scalding hot chocolate, to the freezer, back to scalding hot chocolate, back to the freezer, and then popped my candies out, almost completely clean.  Then I just threw them in the dishwasher.  Took them out, and they're in perfect condition.  I'm impressed!

4.0,0.0,"I have never owned a wine chiller before. I have bought a few as a gift, but they usually had some kind of complex set-up, took up a lot of room, or in one case, made a lot of noise. Needless to say, I never felt the need for such an item.

After getting BlizeTec's chill stick, I am now a happy owner of a wine chiller and have a great gift idea for my minimalist friends. There are only two parts to assemble: the stainless steal stick and a twist pourer top, so you can store it away when it is not in use.

The instructions are very simple, including pictures on the back of the packaging. To summarize: chill the stick for at least two hours, insert the stick into bottle and twist the pourer into the top of the stick, give it a little bit of time to sit (I left it for 10 minutes) and then enjoy a cold glass of wine. Once done, you can easily wash it and throw it back in the freezer. The only thing that I would change in the 4 step process, is to include verbiage around twisting in the pourer, though it is obvious per the images.

I keep a few bottles of wine refrigerated and after trying out this chiller, I see that it keeps the wine nice and cold and the aesthetically pleasing pourer also functions as a stopper, it would definitely be great for entertaining or a picnic.

I recommend having one or two handy, as they take up limited space and simply look good.",Perfect wine chiller for a minimalist,2019-11-01,40075,932455,0,0.1438559189389305

The rod will fit into the wine bottle perfectly and on top of that,  you can adjust how cool you want your wine to be by leaving the rod in the bottle for different periods of time. This one gets rid of all the hassle that comes with having to deal with slippery ice cubes.

5.0,3.0,"I'm not gonna hide my enthusiasm - I love this wine chiller! First, I will say that it is as described. It does what its product description here on Amazon says it does, which is a big plus in my book. The pictures don't quite do it justice. When I saw the pictures I was thinking of something lightweight, maybe kind of cheap to the touch. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually had the wine chiller in my hand. It was made of quality material and had a nice weight to it. The stainless steel chiller rod is durable, and if you take care of it, should last you quite a while.

The packaging was nice and simple and appropriate to the size of the chiller. The instructions are printed on the packaging and they are simple, very easy to follow. When I saw the chiller online, I had some concerns about the stopper. But it worked wonderfully! I tried it in a couple of different bottles (even a vodka and bourbon bottle) and it sealed tightly in each one. The design of the spout is simple, but I find it aesthetically pleasing. It's not over-the-top and looks pretty if you have the bottle sitting out on the table.

I was impressed by how well the chiller rod worked. I am someone who prefers their wine quite cold, so I let the chiller sit in the bottle for about 10 minutes before I pour a glass. It's perfect for me; if you're someone who prefers their wine more chilled than cold, then I would just let it chill for the recommended 5 minutes. Maybe even less, depending on your preferences because the chiller works pretty fast.

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is on the go, like myself, and never remembers to chill a bottle of wine prior to coming home from a long day's work. Salute!",Great for girls on the go!,2023-08-23,40075,2687912,1,0.5983102047213812
4.0,2.0,"I just tried the Wine Chiller: BlizeTec 3-in-1 Stainless Steel Wine Bottle Cooler Stick with Aerator and Pourer for the first time last night.  Its a big name for a really small and handy appliance.  Its a sleek-looking silver tube at the bottom with a nifty pourer at the top.

One of the good things about the wine chiller is that it comes with plain easy-to-understand instructions.  Four simple steps and I was all set.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I didn't have to wait 8-24 hours for the wine chiller to freeze.

Per the instructions, I popped it into the freezer for two hours when I got home from work and by the time I was ready to eat, the wine chiller was ready also.  I screwed on the pourer, placed the wine chiller in the bottle of wine, and let it stand.  It did overflow a tiny bit, but that was completely my fault because the directions did say to pour off a little of the wine before inserting chiller, which I forgot to do.

The instructions said to let it stand for about five minutes, but that wasn't quite chilled enough for me.  So I let it stay in for about 10 minutes total and everything was just fine.  Overall I would recommend the BlizeTec Wine Chiller.  Love the stainless steel tube.  This is perfect for when you pick up some wine on the way home.  Its ready by the time dinner is.

4.0,2.0,"This wine chiller arrived excellently packaged in a small box with clear instructions printed on the side. As someone who often loses instruction pamphlets or never bothers to read them, I found this to be a nice touch. The chiller itself has three functions and is made of two separate components; a stainless steel chill stick and a durable plastic and BPA-free rubber spout.

My favorite part about this product was actually the built in aerator. Before using this product, I had assumed that wine aerators served no actual purpose, aside from making people who owned one feel fancy. However, after aerating my wine, I noticed a significant improvement in its taste.

After washing both parts of this stellar item, I placed the chill stick in the freezer for 5 hours, just to be on the safe side. This chill stick is fool proof. The most difficult part about this process is waiting for it to get cold enough. After waiting the allotted amount of time, I used this wine chiller with a room temperate bottle of white moscato that had been hanging out on my counter for quite some time. I was pleased to find that the chill stick also fits into most beer and cider bottles.

The only downside was that I was expecting this item to make my wine as cold as it would be if it had been refrigerated. Instead, even when used properly, the chill stick chilled my wine to a temperature somewhere between room temperature and fridge temperature.

Category: Heating, Cooling & Air Quality

One of the best surprises about this compact unit is the quiet whitenoise. It helps soothe yourself quietly. This is very space efficent. Easy to take apart to clean and light enough to move around with ease. This would be a wonderful gift for any new parent and baby. The air moves gently to comfort.",A Comfort To Use,2020-05-08,41968,2917023,0,0.1341584398522798
5.0,0.0,"The presentation of this fan is great- there's a whole line of nursery products in this unisex color scheme that's quite attractive. The box is attractive, and well designed with a 50's retro sort of look, and would make a good impression as a gift.

The air circulatory is well designed. The cord is in the base, and it is covered- you only have to reel out what you need. The controls on the top are fairly baby safe- one has to mash the control down to move it. The fan is also designed so that little fingers can get hurt. Only a mutant alien baby should be able to get their fingers passed the grate and inside to the moving parts of this fan.

I like that the grates come off with a drill so that they can be separately washed. My house gets a bit dusty and I really like this feature.

I also like the SOUND of this fan when it is on high. It's a low pitched white noise that I find pleasant. It is much more soothing than the box fan we own.

The fan itself does not oscillate, but it can be aimed up or down. It is not designed to be a fan, though when on the high setting it does function as one in that I can feel the air on me. On low, it's very quiet, and is not felt directly as much, though I could tell that it was circulating air in the room I was testing it in. It has a patented design that sucks air in and moves it around- according to their promotional materials, it circulates air 9.5 times an hour. It really seems like it is even more than that to me.

I like this fan, and I think it is very attractive, with very nice packaging and instruction booklet. I like the safety features. I think that parents will continue to find the fan a welcome and useful addition to their home long after baby becomes a child. Adults that enjoy a fan in their bedrooms, but don't like the sound, should find this one a nice alternative.

It is designed and supported in the USA, in Canada, but it is manufactured in China.  I HIGHLY recommend this unit - It really does a great job of moving air, and yet is gentle and not at all noisy.","Nice safety features, works well, attractive line of baby products- sounds soothing, and effectively moves the air",2023-05-16,41968,2837802,1,0.6810569393091048
4.0,0.0,"I really like this fan for my 18 month old son's nursery.  Living in South Louisiana, I like to have some sort of air circulation going on his in room.  However, the name of the product is a little misleading.  I thought that this would simply circulate air, and not have any directional cool air.  But all this is a is a baby-proof fan.

Baby-Proof features include:
 - The cord wraps underneath the unit.
 - The buttons have a lock feature so that small hands can turn on the fan.
 - It has zero sharp edges and there are no gaps where a small finger can accidentally get caught.

For those reasons, I really do like this fan for the warmer months of the year.",Cute and functional in the hotter months,2020-05-07,41968,6081130,0,0.408738494293196
5.0,2.0,"Our family has a Vornado fan that we run every night for white noise as we sleep. We've been doing so for over eleven years, and we actually inherited the fan from my in-laws - they'd had it for a while before us. Only recently have we started to have any issues with the fan (every few weeks it will take a minute or so to get spinning). Up to this point, it's been super reliable and low/no maintenance.

It's quickly evident that the Vornadobaby Breesi Nursery Air Circulator (which is another way of saying ""fan"") is of a similar quality. It's solid and well-designed and particularly well-suited for a room with little people. For instance, the cord (about 4 feel long) coils into the base of the fan under a rubber cover so you can extend it as needed and not have extra cord out. This rubber base is kind of grippy so the fan is steady and won't slide when bumped (it's also fairly bottom-heavy so it's not prone to toppling over). The fan can be aimed up and down in a way that won't pinch fingers. Little fingers can fit into the air slots and won't get bonked by fan blades. The speed control toggle must be pressed down before you can slide it and adjust the fan speed.

All in all, nice features for a fan that I expect we'll have running in our home for many years to come.",Cute Design; Effective Fan,2023-03-03,41968,1948408,1,0.9226718258378032

(This sort of thing happens a lot with young animals). I was still able to coil any unneeded length of power cord into the fan's base.

4.0,0.0,"Like other reviewers said (and I failed to listen)...it's just a fan. Sure it's baby proof in that you have to press down on the power switch and then slide it left and right to go on and off, and the slots are fairly small to prevent fingers from reaching in, but that's about it. It makes a lot of creaking noises when you're turning it on and off or adjusting the fan tilt direction, which is agitating.. So if you're trying to keep a baby from waking up or staying chillaxed, you better not bother fidgeting with the fan.

In terms of circulation and cooling factor, I wouldn't say it circulates air any better than any other fan. If anything, because it doesn't oscillate, I feel like it might circulate not as well. I also wish there was a medium setting. Low is like someone is whispering in your ear, and high is like being stuck in a wind tunnel.

I have had one serious breakout since using the cloths and that was after a reaction to a drug, not anything else. I notice when I start to get any pimples or rosacea papules (if you want to get technical about it) they heal much, much faster and much, much less visible than they used to be. I can honestly say these cloths have made a very noticeable difference to my skin.

Added bonus is they are slightly abrasive and will give your face the kind of smooth, polished feel one gets after using a face scrub without the redness and irritation that follow.

Caution: These do not feel like a regular washcloth, think the chamois you use on your car to clean and wax it.

5.0,6.0,"I have always used non-stick pots and pans but jumped at the opportunity to order this gorgeous cookware set through Amazon VIne. I cook nearly every day, so I put these pots and pans to a thorough test.

Cooking: I absolutely love using this cookware! There are measurement markings inside most of the pans, so you can measure liquids right into them. They are heavy and high quality and look like expensive cookware. The handles do stay cool, and I rarely need a pot holder to lift them. I like the fact that they are not plastic or covered with some sort of cushioned material so that they can go into the oven or under the broiler. The pans heat up quickly and are perfect for searing meat. The seared bits stuck to the pan release easily when liquid is added and stirred, to make a delicious and flavorful sauce.

Cautions: Unlike non-stick pans, you are not supposed to use cooking spray on these-- the directions say not to. Instead, I use a small amount of olive oil and spread it across the pan in a thin layer with a paper towel, so that I don't add too many calories to my dishes. Sometimes I will use a little butter instead of oil, depending on what I'm cooking. The directions also say to use lower heat, except when boiling water. I have gas burners and usually use lower heat anyway, but the pans do heat very quickly and retain heat with an even cooking temperature. Be sure to use wooden or non-metal utensils to avoid scratching the stainless steel.

Cleaning: The cookware is listed as dishwasher-safe, but I have always hand washed my pots and pans. In order to make a fair review, I hesitantly put one pot in the lower rack of my dishwasher. When the cycle finished, I was pleased to see that the outside of the pot was still shiny and new. However, when I turned it over, I saw that the inside was discolored where the food had been, even though I had rinsed it well. I was disappointed to see my beautiful pot had a stained appearance, but luckily I work with a chef, and he told me to use a non-abrasive scouring powder. Since I use Bar Keeper's Friend on my stainless steel sink, I gave that a try. A little sprinkle got rid of the stain completely! Just be sure to wash the pans well after cleaning them this way!

Overall, I couldn't be happier with this cookware. I know it will last for decades, plus it has a lifetime warranty. Highly recommended!",Never going back to non-stick cookware!,2023-06-24,43879,1258596,1,0.8206536185861157

5.0,3.0,"This is the most beautiful set of cookware I've ever seen or used - married 31 years and have used Farberware, Calphalon, the works! The lids are heavy construction and look like they will last forever. The pots themselves are amazing, let's just say Oxo thought of everything; there is a pot or pan for every use you can think of. The heft of these pans is absolutely amazing - very heavy construction. The saucepans have slightly sloped bases so nothing gets stuck in a corner anywhere. Oxo also has a pretty ingenious design that truly is drip proof, so when you drain pans and put them back on the stove you don't have to worry about a scorched cooking surface. The stay cool handles really do stay cool, though I did use a potholder after using one of the pans in the oven. Another really awesome thing is the measurements inside the pans, though I haven't had to rely on the measurements yet.

This set is dishwasher safe, but I'm still doing them by hand... at least for now. Something this beautiful still needs tender loving care, especially since I love them so much!",Not your mamma's stainless,2023-08-09,43879,4373784,1,0.8034100673761531
5.0,5.0,"Feels like an early Christmas gift! What a nice set of pots and pans. You can feel the quality just picking one up. The handles feel comfortable in your hand. You can tell they really thought about all angles and aspects of using pots and pans. The weight feels like these will be very durable and last the long run. I made dinner using these last night and was very impressed. I cooked bacon first and then you take the bacon out and have to get rid of about half or more of the grease and save the rest for the sauce. I usually hate this part because the grease pours out sloppily and drips down the side, and then makes it way to the bottom of the pan. I often stop and get a washcloth with some soapy water on it to wipe it before returning it to the stove. But this time the bacon grease poured out neatly and nothing dripped. I love it. Then I sauteed onions in the little bit of bacon grease left, and finally add crushed tomatoes. It's not always a fun pan to clean, with the bits of bacon stuck to the bottom and all that cooking. But in these pan it was a quick and easy clean-up. I used the large pot to cook pasta and that was really nice as well.  I also love the variety of sizes this set comes with. It seems they put a lot of thought into the needs of cooks.",Looks like a lot of thought went into the making of these.,2023-12-12,43879,2431623,1,0.5334663741563757
5.0,19.0,"These well-made 3-ply stainless steel pots and pans from OXO have good ergonomic designs and a little bit of heft to them.  They heat up quickly and hold heat well, so using medium level heat should be fine. The drip-free pouring edges are as advertised and the handles are easy and comfortable to grip.  They come with lifetime warranty.

The 8"", 10"", and 12"" pans have depths of 1.75"", 2"", and 2.75"" respectively.  The 8"" pan is good for cooking omelettes and sauteing vegetables, while the 12"" pan is good for preparing large meals.  Every now and then, food does stick onto the bottom of the pan.  When this happens, I've had great success at unsticking the food by simply pouring some water onto the still hot pan, then using my non-abrasive utensil to lift the food fragments off.

All of the pots come with clear glass lids that don't have vent holes in them.  All of the pots and pans are rated oven safe up to 430 degrees fahrenheit, so you can move them from stovetop to the oven directly if you have to.

Even though these pots and pans are rated dishwasher safe, some of the bigger pots don't fit my dishwasher, so I just handwash all of them, which is not really a big chore because they're easy to clean.","Lifetime warranty, heat quickly and hold heat well, a bit heavy but good ergonomic design",2023-08-30,43879,5421889,1,0.9186719303226278
5.0,7.0,"LOVE THESE! I have owned several types of cookware, including Emeril, and I like these by OXO better!

First, the handle is more ergonomic- it's wider, easier to grip, and it's solid! No hollow handles to drip stuff into by accident!
.
There are measurement markings on the INSIDE of the pans to indicate how much stuff you have put in. This is genius! Long overdue!

The bottom of the inside of each pan is rounded rather than having a sudden 90-degree angle. This makes it easier to mix, and easier to reduce liquids that tend to rise up the side of the pan.  Someone who cooks was really thinking when they designed these pans!

They weigh less than my Emerils.  They are very well made, and sit nice and flat on my flat cooktop surface.

I love how they feel in my hand...

Much as I love my All Clad skillets and saut&eacute; pans, I just couldn't pull the trigger on the price of their saucier (which I believe they now call an ""everything pan""), so I picked up the OXO 3.5 qt saucepan,
because I thought that the curved shape would be great for stirring.  It worked out nicely and I was impressed enough to go ahead and purchase the 13 piece set.  It was time to replace that 20 year old Calphalon non-stick set anyway.

I've been using these pots and pans pretty much daily over the last three months and absolutely love them.  They are great from a performance perspective and I haven't had any problems getting them clean.  Every once in a while, I'll have to use Bar Keepers Friend on a particularly stubborn spot.  But, for the most part, they clean up easily after ten minutes of soaking in hot, soapy water.  (Personal preference:  I never wash my cookware in the dishwasher.)

I love the variety of pots in this set and feel like I always have the perfect pan for a task at my fingertips.  And, seriously, they are so darn cute.  I know that this sounds silly, but the rounded shapes on the pots are visually pleasing.

3.0,14.0,"Sideswipe make a more effective wiping beater -- it wipes more of the bowl and wipes it more thoroughly --  but it a bit more work to clean.

The beater is coated so you don't have the tarnish/food contamination prob the aluminum ones have. But the painted beaters do eventually chip. If only they made a stainless steel version.
This is made for the 6 qt glass flared bowl. If you have a steel bowl you probably want model KFE6L instead of this one. The KLN version of Sideswiper works on the 6qt flared glass bowl but only if you don't have a full bowl, then, it's a bit short, but has an aluminum insert where the beater attaches to the mixer--the main body is a strong plastic which has held up very well--other brands have cracked.

I did some research and discovered that the metal bowl is wider at the top and the glass bowl is narrower. This does make a difference because all 6qt scraper blades are not created equal. I had to return it and bought this one. It is the same color as the paddle and hook that came with the bowl. Im guessing Kitchenaid color codes the attatchments for consistency.

5.0,0.0,"Hay fever, dogs, an old house under construction, life in a polluted city - I have all the uneasy breathing culprits, so I knew I would be putting this thing through its paces. I used this in my master bedroom (250 square feet) and I have been beyond happy.

The AeraMax comes with two filters - HEPA and carbon. It has a small footprint, which is nice in a small room, and it looks sleek and modern in the space. The interface is easy to use with straight-forward buttons that are very responsive. There is a night/day mode so you can have bright or low illumination depending on the ambient light, in addition to fan control, a lock and an alert that lets you know what level of purification the purifier is running at (high, med, low).

Very quiet, this is generally silent when it is running on low, but for those times that it kicks up into a higher gear, it sounds like a fan. It wouldn't be loud enough to wake you up, but it is definitely noticeable.

So how does it work? Amazing. I have noticed fewer allergies and it kicks into high gear whenever I do something that releases dust (spray my hair with dry shampoo, shake a rug, etc.) so I know it is working. I don't have a good way of testing fine particles, but the visible dust in the air is definitely reduced and I have noticed a change in air quality. I can't comment on whether this is good for babies, but for an adult, it is awesome.",Breathing easier.,2023-09-30,47328,5153601,1,0.568677597661052

My little one has suffered from allergies since 4 months old. I have tried a variety of air purifiers before finding this one. What I notice is different about this one Aeramax is that it's much quieter than many other purifiers on the market. I also like how compact it is, which means it easily fits into any space. This unit also blows a subtle breeze into the room and makes the air feel fresh.

Now that my little one is in the toddler phase, I am so glad this unit has a lock feature to prevent her from changing settings or turning it off!

My favorite feature is the sensor that detects airborne contaminants and adjusts performance of the purifier automatically. So, you can leave the unit on all the time and know that the air is clean.

I always love to set a nice table, but our fine china requires handwashing, so it is mostly reserved for holidays and occasions where I have extra hands to help with clean up.  lol

I have to admit that I didn't really feel comfortable trying the microwave-safe claim on our regular microwave at first.  One of our sons had fried one of our microwaves by leaving a utensil in while he heated something so I was a little scarred from that experience.  lol  I decided to use the microwave we gave our daughter to take to college...just in case.  It would be less expensive to replace that microwave than our high end one, so it seemed like a less painful risk.  I was looking for any of the telltale ""arc-ing or sparking"" that lets you know you have metal in the microwave, but the microwave operated completely normally...no signs anything was amiss.  After a few event-less warming runs in her microwave, we are now comfortable using it in our own, should the need arise.

This plate has been through the dishwasher countless times and it doesn't show any signs of wear or chipping whatsoever.  The ""Shades of Teal"" color is a very subtle, attractive shade that would look especially nice with darker accent pieces in the pace setting, too.","Feels very strange to microwave gold trim, but it works!

5.0,16.0,"We bought some ""blackout"" curtains at a big box store a year or so ago and I was really dissapointed to find out they didn't really block all the light. I should have read the fine print when I purchased them because I didn't realize that blackout curtains were not all guaranteed to block all light. I was offered these curtains at a discount in exchange for my honest review and I jumped at the chance to throw my old ones in the trash. Here's what I think.

Pros:
+ Great price. You won't find curtains of this quality, for this cheap, at a big box store.
+ They are really nice quality. The curtains are thick and the stitching is well done. I don't see any loose threads at all.
+ The size was exactly as described.
+ They were very easy to hang because of the large metal rings sown into the top. The holes are large and will fit a large variety of rods.
+ Oh yeah, they work. Light, gone. It's much cooler in the room now as well.

Cons:
- Not a huge variety of colors and sizes.

It fits nicely in my hand and is easy to carry.  It holds up to 17 oz. of liquid.  I fill it up in the morning with water and a couple of ice cubes and it stays cold all day long.  That's what I love about the stainless steel water bottles... how they really keep your drink cold!!

I attached a picture of it next to one of my sparking water bottles so you can get an idea of size.

Cons:  The only con is having to twist off the lids every time you take a drink.  BUT the lid is what really makes it leakproof.  I haven't had any of my pop-up lids on water bottles be completely leak proof.  And I would love if they would offer this in larger sizes too.

4.0,0.0,"My kids are a big fan of water beads. I have bought several sets over the last few years. With the right care, these will hold up for many hours of play. I like to only use about 1/3 of the bag at a time. I find the best effect is to pour the beads into a clear cake pan or container. The clear lets the kids see the colors better and it looks nice on the counter. I placed the beads into the pan and poured enough water to go almost, to the top of the container. Be aware that the beads really expand so make sure to use a large enough container for them. Within an hour, they have already tripled or more in size. Within 4-8 hours, they are at full size.

I place a towel done and set the pan of beads on it. I then add some little toys, all of the same theme, a few small cups, a small ladle, and a few other things I think are cool. My son will spend an hour or more, playing with all of this. Sea creatures go very well with these as does little monster like creatures.

I recommend rinsing them off after play and storing in a container with a lid. My kids also love watching the beads dry back up. I strain out the beads, then spread them out on a cookie sheet. It can take a couple of days to full shrink. It depends on how dry it is in the house.

I like that these are a bit more unique than any others I have gotten before. It is almost like they are clear with the color in the very center. The beads hold up pretty well. I did initially have to pull a handful out that fell to pieces as they soaked up some water. Once I pulled out any defective beads, they have held up pretty well. You may have to rinse them a few times, initially. The completely clear ones seemed to be the ones that fell apart the worst.

These also look really nice in a vase or decorative bowl. They are very relaxing to play with.

They arrive in the form of tiny little beads jam-packed in a plastic bag that is about 3 inches by 3 inches. You put them in a glass, ""water"" them--and watch them grow, literally. They are quite colorful, and their composition is such that they can hold your flower arrangement, artificial or real, in a way that no other vase filler can. Unlike styrofoam vase fillers that are ruined and unusable if you switch too many flowers around in it, these water beads always work, and your flower stems just stay were you want them. My understanding is that some children with sensory sensitivities also like to ""feel"" these beads and play with them. The beads do have an interesting feel--sort of wet but not wet, yet not sticky. If you decide that you don't need a vase of beads anymore, you simply spill them out onto a cookie pan and let them dry. They shrink right back up. They can be used again and again.

5.0,3.0,"I really love how much water these hold. It did take awhile for the beads to reach their full potential.
But just put them in a big cake pan filled with water came back, checked them after 4 hours put more water in the pan
came back 2 hours later filled it more and came back 2 hours they soaked up over 100 oz of water.
You can definitely tell when they need more because the ""skin"" of the bead is wrinkled.
I think a few got a big too much water because I noticed some were broke open and split.
Not too many though.
I find that these beads are great for plants and hope to cut my watering my plants down to every other day.

Thought I would surprise the wife with a new centerpiece for the table complete with some flowers, but I am afraid that didn't happen.  Apparently, my kids had already had experience with this kind of thing and as soon as they saw them, they removed the flowers and had water beads all over the kitchen table and floor before I knew what they were up to.  These things are so much fun - even for teenagers!  Of course, the boys wanted to see what it takes to break them...and yes, they will break/burst.  One word of caution, keep track of any that hit the floor because they feel really gross to step on with bare feet in the middle of night, and if you don't find them before they dry out, they hurt when you step on them in the tiny hard bead form.

5.0,0.0,"When I first ordered these, I planned on using them in my potted plants to ensure they never go dry. After receiving them however, I realized that while they would work great for that purpose, they were far too cute  to bury in the dirt!
I have used water beads for the past decade in both my potted plants and also in the ground when planting perennials. They work great as a backup source of moisture for those dry spells or if you forget to water the potted plant. (Especially moisture sensitive plants like Impatiens).  However these beads are so beautiful and colorful, I didn't want to use them underground! Instead I am using them in a vase for cut flowers and also have some in a smaller bottle that I use for plant cuttings that I am attempting to root.
These beads increase in size FAR more than my usual brand of water beads! (I believe the brand is SoilMoist, which are intended for use in soil). These beads start out the size of a pin head, and when you add water they plump up to a Skittle size! (Hope the reference/comparisons help!) They are in a range of colors: red, yellow, black, green, blue to  name a few. VERY, very colorful! They arrived in a small unimpressive Ziploc baggie. Directions said to soak several hours to overnight, but didn't really give a water to bead ratio. I added one tablespoon of beads to one cup of water and they increased in size so much I thought they would overflow the cup! (See photos). I have had them in this glass cup for over a week now, and they have not dried out yet! They did shrink a tiny bit, but barely noticeable.

This runner, though, is one that I have convinced him only needs to be on our dining room table for one month out of the year And it does look great! It nicely fits our oval table and the skulls hang to the perfect length on either side and look great with our fall tablecloth that is a sort of goldish color. The skulls are a metallic gold and catch the light nicely. The black color does mean that the other side of it gets some dog hair visibly stuck to it due to the dog eagerly heading under the table for generous offerings or fallen tidbits. I was a little nervous to wash it because of the metallic, and so I have to say that it shakes/was lint rolled clean enough to store until next year.

5.0,2.0,"We have a large collection of holiday Lenox dishes and serving pieces what we like to use from the day after thanksgiving to just after New Years. Since we have seven kids I generally have the younger ones use plain cream color plates so the table setting will more or less match without my having to stress over the good plates being broken.

This new melamine version is a nice compromise between letting little ones use the good china and having a table that doesn't match for special meals. While I do wish they had chosen a material besides melamine I don't mind since we only use them for one Sunday dinner each week plus Christmas Eve and Christmas Day meals.

The plates themselves are well made and have stood up to being handled and dropped by our little ones. They wash up well in the dishwasher. The size is nearly an exact match to our regular Lenox plates. The only slightly disappointing thing about these is that the rim is green which does not match the gold rim on our other dishes. Not a big deal but worth mentioning. All in all these plates are a nice option for families or groups with young children or for parties where adults will be milling around and plates are more likely to be dropped.",perfect for families with young children,2023-12-03,59180,556679,1,0.569017037069776
3.0,0.0,"Melamine is an organic based plastic which results in dinnerware that is far less likely than china to break. It is lightweight and easy to handle. While dishwasher safe, it is not microwave safe. It is often used for the kids but can also be used for picnics or outdoor settings where you don't want to have heavy dishes to deal with. There have been some safety concerns surrounding melamine since absorption of the product could have toxic effects. Generally speaking, if cold food is served on melamine there is very likely no problem at all. If HOT food is served on the product, though, a study in JAMA showed that there could be some absorption.

These dishes are festive for the winter holidays, with a white overall appearance surrounded by holly leaves and berries. My four plates arrived in good condition but for a small surface crack on one plate. I picked at it to see if it went all the way through the dish; it didn't, but the green chipped away easily next to the crack...a little annoying.

Bottom line: I think I'll use these as a bottom plate, with a smaller plate placed on top from which to eat. That way there are no potential issues with the melamine and I still have the festive appearance.","Melamine concerns, a small crack in the plastic, and festive appearance all discussed below",2022-01-24,59180,4133098,0,0.4031989780296952

3.0,3.0,"This soft cotton-weave tablecloth with holly leaf stitching is an attractive addition to any casual dining room d&eacute;cor.

While Im not Consumer Reports, I do try to put my Vine review items through a home-based product testing cycle. I found this fabric color fast but not shrink fast. The rich cherry-colored material doesnt bleed into the wash transforming your whites into pinks. It stood up to repeated washing cycles without fraying, pulling, or snagging.

Shrinkage was a problem after cold-water washing and low-heat drying, with the sides losing about 6 and the ends about 8.  Additionally, the shrinkage was uneven - my tablecloth went in a rectangle and came out a rhombus.

The holly boughs set against the red background hides wrinkles and minor stains. This tablecloth has the soft look and feel of a bedspread or blanket. I could see this as a throw on the back of a chair just as easily as a covering for the table. For that reason, this is more of a picnic-style covering for casual dining. This is not a tablecloth for a formal table setting.

What I loved about this tablecloth was the ease of use (no ironing), the design (holly boughs) and feel (soft). The cloth may be casual, but the price is at the high end of the spectrum making the shrinkage expensive. Overall, I give this attractive holiday-themed tablecloth three stars.",Lightweight,2021-12-10,60630,2098122,0,0.4255
5.0,0.0,"This is a festive printed Christmas dining table runner that added a cheerful note to our celebration. We own many things from DII -- tablecloths, runners, placemats, napkins -- even an apron or two. We find that the company provides good quality. For example, this is 100% cotton, the fabric has some weight to it, and feels good to the hand. It does wrinkle, so we wash on cool, tumble dry on delicate, remove the cloth from the dryer while still damp, and iron on low.

4.0,26.0,"This Indian-made cotton tablecloth has a lovely texture and nice body. I love the really dark navy blue and white check. When I put it on my 42"" by 72"" table is hung nicely, with about 5"" to spare at either end and about a 7"" drop on either side. I washed it on cool gentle cycle with mild detergent and dried at a low-heat setting for 15 minutes and then took it out and hung it over the shower rod to dry the rest of the way. However, even though I was gentle with it, the tablecloth shrunk. The width shrunk only about 2"" or 3"", but the length shrunk about 6"", because now I have only about 2"" hanging down on either end. I am still using it, but I'm hoping it won't shrink any more when I wash it again, because it definitely would not cover the top of my table. I love the tablecloth other than that. If your table is shorter than mine, you might be able to use it after it has shrunk in the wash. Or maybe you could buy one that is really too big and taylor the ends to fit your table after you wash it.

Update April 29, 2013: Some reviewers have mentioned shrinkage on these tablecloths. I've been washing mine in warm water and drying it on the high setting for more than six months (it's too much work to mollycoddle table linens).

5.0,0.0,"This is a great apron! Baking is one of my favorite hobbies and I have a collection of about ten different aprons. I find myself returning over and over to an old red Christmas apron because it protects my clothing and washes well. My husband thinks it is ugly and it has begun to hold on to odors in its old age so it is being retired to become a craft apron. I have been needing a really durable apron that is comfortable, not too heavy (my pink canvas apron weighs a ton), not so expensive and fancy that it can't ever be used (sigh, I already have one of those) and can be shoved in the washer covered in flour, egg and who-knows-what-else and come out looking as good as new. I think I have found that apron!

 Material: This apron is sturdy but flexible. It is made out of the same type of material khakis are typically stitched from but this one comes in a very pretty winter smoke gray. (Not silver, no blue undertones - closer to a charcoal but not quite that dark.) The sea foam ties are made of the same material. (The ties are not aqua blue - they are definitely a shade of dusty sea foam-y mint green.)  The weave is sturdy, like restaurant quality aprons, but the material is softer and more comfortable. You know how restaurant aprons feel almost as if they are starched stiff? This apron uses good material but the material moves. It is NOT scratchy! It has what I call ""twenty year"" fabric. The kind that lasts for a good twenty years and only gets softer as it ages.

 Tie Length: A generous 35 inches! Enough to loop around and tie in front, even if you are curvy! Because let's face it, good bakers are curvy! :)

 Length: I am 5'7"" and the apron falls 1 inch above my knees. The neck is adjustable (thick, sturdy black plastic slider). The apron begins about 2 inches below my collar bone, providing full coverage down my front. This is awesome because I make a MESS with flour when I bake our family's old world strudel recipe!

 Pockets: The pockets are each 7.5 inches deep and between 6.6 and 6.75 inches wide, depending on the stitching. If you want one big pocket, the apron can be flipped over and the single center seam ripped out. This part was stitched last and would be easy to undo. The stitching looks to be good quality and is secure. I haven't found any loose threads, sloppy stitching or shoddy workmanship anywhere on the apron.

I was fortunate to receive this apron for free to try out before writing a review. I cook dinner almost every single night of the week and bake at least once per week so I know good utensils and good aprons! This one is a good apron!",35 inch long ties for double wrapping  7.5 inch deep pockets  Secure Stitching  Nice Long Apron!,2023-09-15,62155,1668256,1,0.8388761071142359

My review:
I was looking for a great manly apron for my grilling man, and this was perfect! It's higher quality than the funny ones I considered, and it looks great on him! :) It washes well & doesn't show BBQ & all the other things he manages to get on it. The pocket is great for his the things he's always struggling to keep up with when he needs an extra hand (rag, tongs, meat thermometer, cell phone, etc.) Perfectly described, and we couldn't be happier! Thanks for helping me get major brownie points! These are very good aprons. I try to dress fairly nice all the time, so I wear an apron everyday when I cook and clean the kitchen. I don't like a frilly look, these are very useful and make me look like a chef rather than a housewife. They are a good value, and arrived quickly. I only wear white ones so that I can add a bit of bleach to them in the wash. I will buy again.

I spent considerable time looking at aprons. My wife wears them everyday. So I wanted to make sure the aprons I ordered had pockets, which she wanted, and did not have in her Sams Club aprons. They cover a LOT of area so you'll really have to be slinging things around to get something past the apron and onto your clothes. I also wanted to be sure they were plenty large with drawstrings long enough to wrap around and tie in the front. The drawstrings are sturdy material and all the stitching on the aprons is really well done. The Wamery aprons are the bom digety of aprons. IE, they're exceptional. The fabric isn't as heavy as asbestos nor as thin as cheesecloth. It's a nice sturdy kitchen grade fabric perfect for aprons. They're not stiff and starchy (ie, they're not going to hold you upright while you take a combat nap in the kitchen!) but they also aren't going to saturate when you wipe your hands on them. They're just excellent. Even the colors are perfect, classy. I didn't even consider the colors before I ordered but they really look professional. If you don't know what you're doing in the kitchen no one will know by your apron! We like them so much we ordered several for a family member who also spends time in the kitchen baking. Highly recommended. Will buy them again. If you need a great kitchen apron, stop looking, you found it!",Wamery aprons are the bom digety of aprons,2023-09-23,62155,3546659,1,0.908600020021274
5.0,2.0,"I purchased this apron because I liked the look of it. Since I constantly wear aprons around the house, since I'm always cooking or baking, I tend to be wearing an apron when I answer the door.
 Hence the need for a nice looking apron, that I won't be embarrassed to answer the door when wearing. I used to have to quickly pull off my apron before opening the door, but now I just keep this on, and still feel well dressed.
Now as for the functionality of this apron, when I wore my other apron, some part of my cloths were sure to still get dirty, as all the other aprons I have are so much smaller. This Apron, as you can see in my photos, is so much larger, and really covers my cloths as I work.

Used this with my Queen mattress and it fit fine. The cover held up and I could see myself using this at least a few more times. I just refolded it up and put it away.

I'm not much for gold but this is more of an autumn color. It says natural and is the color of wheat and goes with my gold curtains really nicely.  Jute very rarely needs much care. Just take it outside and shake it when it gets a little dusty. It can be laundered but I don't do that very often since I think they lose their shape slightly in the process. I use these on tables and bookshelves too instead of doilies because I just like them better. DII products are all really nice and I've not been displeased with anything I've gotten yet.,I got this to lay across a top shelf in there and it looks great.

4.0,0.0,"This review is for the Dll Jute Rustic Vintage Table Runner.  I have purchased several items from DII. This table runner seemed a good match for my decor.  After receiving it I immediately placed it on the table for our Thanksgiving meal. It was the perfect addition. Because I like a rustic, farmhouse look this was a great match. The runner like many of the burlap top items from this vendor was a bit loosely woven.  While I would not want that in a placemat it work just fine for the table runner.  I  anticipate this being a versatile piece. I am already thinking it would look good on my entry buffet. The one I have is in the natural color; I would like to try to purchase in other colors such as the red.

5.0,0.0,"I bought the set for my daughter and overall we are both pleased. The aprons are a very lightweight poly cotton blend. The white one has two light red hearts and the words ""Mrs. est. 2016"". The black one has the words ""Mr. est. 2016"". Don't expect heavy weight aprons as these are thin. They feel as though there may be a stain resistant coating on them. It's anyone's best guess on care. Washing instructions are not included.

Overall the aprons seem well made. The straps are sturdy and are sewn onto the aprons well. I didn't notice any flaws there or issues with workmanship. There is no bleeding on the edges of the design. All is crisp and clear - even on the black apron. The aprons fit the bill well as a shower or wedding gift.

The aprons are more narrow than ones I already own and shorter. The neck straps are adjustable which helps. Just don't expect heavy weight aprons. These are thin, but cute, but they are thin. My daughter enjoys cooking and says that she is looking forward to using them. That's all I can ask for. :)

5.0,3.0,"Such a great idea! I'm always asking my husband if the dishes are clean or dirty, probably every day since we have different schedules. This sign is just a couple inches long and maybe an inch wide or so, so not too big. The sign came nicely packaged and with sticky tape precut so that I  could tape the sign to my dishwasher if needed. Unfortunately the magnet wouldn't work on my older dishwasher so I did add the tape. The tape is double sided and precut to fit the two squares on the back of the sign. It waa very easy to apply the tape and then I immediately pressed the sign against the dishwasher and haven't had any issues with the sign falling off. The ""dishes"" slides seamlessly from right to left so now I don't have to ask my husband multiple times if the dishes are clean or dirty. Overall I am very pleased with this product.
